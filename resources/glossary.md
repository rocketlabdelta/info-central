3FNC - Slang for a basic rocket: “3 Fins and a Nose Cone”. The simplest form a rocket can take is a cylindrical airframe with a pointed or rounded nose, and three stabilizing fins at the rear of the airframe. The size and shape of the fins, the length and diameter of the airframe, and the shape of the nose are all driven by factors related to motor thrust, internal capacity, stability, and style. But the simplest (and most nearly drag-free) design for a rocket is three fins and a nose cone.

### A
Ablation - The flaking and vaporization of material undergoing severe heating due to aerodynamic drag. In a model or high power rocket the only component that typically undergoes ablation is the motor nozzle. This is why, even with a reusable motor system (RMS), the nozzle is usually used only once.

Accelerometer - An electronic device for detecting the presence of high acceleration. An accelerometer can be used for flight data gathering, or for controlling flight events. For example, an accelerometer with a memory chip can record the strength and duration of a rockets acceleration. This data can be used by a computer to calculate the rockets approximate altitude at various points of its ascent. An accelerometer can also be combined with a timer to determine the proper time for a deployment charge or sustainer motor to be activated, by counting down a pre-set number of seconds after acceleration ceases (motor burn-out).

Bernoullis Principle - A physics principle that states the pressure exerted by air perpendicular to its direction of travel decreases with an increase in velocity. This is the theoretical principle upon which airplane wings work. An airplane wings airfoil is unsymmetrical, its upper surface having a greater curve than its lower surface. This causes air flowing across the upper portion of the wing to speed up, since it must cross a greater surface area in the same length of time. The increase in air velocity on the upper surface causes the air pressure in the region just above the wing to be reduced. The higher pressure below the wing presses upward on it, creating lift.

Hybrid - A hybrid propellant rocket motor employs separated propellant ingredients in two different physical states (generally the fuel is a solid while the oxidizer is a liquid). In one common design, pressurized liquefied nitrous oxide (N2O) is employed as the oxidizer while cellulose is utilized as the solid fuel.

Advantages of hybrid motors for HPR rockets include lower cost per flight than solid propellants, less restrictive shipping regulations and elimination of the need to comply with various aspects of the federal explosive laws that regulate the purchase and storage of large solid propellant rocket motors.

This design is less susceptible to zippering and burning. Larger-diameter Kevlar cord is increasingly being used as shock cords on high-power rockets for the same reason, and because Kevlar is stronger than bungee or elastic straps. Kevlar is also woven into sheaths or bags, and used to protect elastic shock cords and parachutes in larger rockets. See Deployment Bag.

Mercury Switch - An electrical switching device consisting of an oval glass bulb which contains two electrical contacts (penetrating the bulb, and at one end of the oval) and a drop of mercury. In hobby rocketry, mercury switches are used to detect the absence of acceleration in a moving rocket. When the rocket launches, acceleration forces hold the mercury drop at the bottom of the bulb, away from the electrical contacts. When the rockets acceleration ceases, the mercury - which is a heavy metal and stores considerable momentum - moves forward in the bulb, bridges the gap between the contacts, and closes the electrical circuit. The electrical circuits controlled by mercury switches are most commonly used to activate recovery system deployment charges or sustainer motor igniters.

Spill Hole - A hole in the center of the canopy of a hemispherical parachute, designed to reduce payload oscillations caused by the canopy spilling air unevenly from its edges.

Spinerons - Tabs attached to the trailing edge of fins and set at an angle, intended to spin the rocket in order to stabilize it.

SSTO - Single Stage To Orbit

Stab - Stabilizer: Usually refers to the fin-like structures at the rear of a conventional boost glider.

Stability - The tendency of a rocket to move in a straight line in the direction it is pointed at launch. A hobby rocket employs “passive” stability, in that it depends on its inherent stability (the relationship of its centers of pressure and gravity) and the counterbalancing pressure of the airflow on its fins to keep it moving in the correct attitude. Missiles and spacecraft usually employ “active” stability schemes, in which attitude jets or movable vanes help correct the rockets course in flight. Stability involves a rockets ability to continue to fly straight when the angle of attack is greater than zero. A stable rocket continues to fly in its intended direction, even if moderate wind or other influences try to change its course. A poorly-designed rocket can be either unstable, marginally stable or excessively stable. An unstable rocket (whose center of gravity is behind its center of pressure) will fly erratically when launched. A marginally stable rocket (whose center of gravity is less than one diameter ahead of its center of pressure) might be able to maintain a straight flight attitude if there is no side wind (angle of attack is zero.) However, if outside forces such as wind intervene (angle of attack greater than zero), the rocket can be thrown off its flight path and behave in an erratic manner. An excessively stable rocket (whose center of gravity is much more than one diameter ahead of its center of pressure) will tend to turn toward those outside forces rather than remain on the intended line of flight. See Weathercocking.

Stall - The angle of maximum lift for an airfoil. Stalls are dangerous because lift dramatically decreases (often to near zero) at any angle past the stall point

Static Balance - A state in which a models center of gravity can be demonstrated to be in a proper relationship to the center of pressure by actually balancing the model on a narrow surface.

Static Firing - The firing of a motor, mounted in such a way that the motor can not move. Used usually with instrumentation, to permit performance measurement.

Static Margin - The diameter of the thickest part of a rockets airframe. The term is synonymous with “caliber” in determining the relationship between CP and CG.

Stines Law - The guiding principle of Rocketry construction and flight: “If at first you dont succeed, try following instructions.”

Streamer - A device for slowing the descent of a rocket, sometimes used in place of a parachute in smaller rockets. The streamer consists of one or more long, narrow lengths of plastic, fabric or paper which are connected to the rocket in the same fashion as a parachute, and which deploy and flutter to slow and stabilize the falling rocket. Since streamers do not slow the descent as much as a parachute, they are normally only used on relatively small or very robustly-built model rockets. However, they are useful in windy conditions since they will not allow the descent to drift as much as a parachute will.

String Test - See Swing Test.

Strip - A condition in which a rockets fins, or a gliders wings, are pulled off the airframe by excess thrust.

Striptease - The “act” of having wings or fins stripped off an airframe. Also, a pop-pod glider that separates from the booster pod prematurely.

Stuffer Tube - A small-diameter tube - commonly an extension of the motor tube - which is used in large-diameter rocket airframes to duct deployment charge gases to the recovery system storage area. This reduces the internal area which must be pressurized by the deployment charge.

Styrofoam - A very light material made of expanded polystyrene plastic. Though Styrofoam has little structural strength, is easily shaped into shapes, such as large nose cones and glider wings, that can be skin-reinforced by fiberglassing or lamination of thin wood veneers.

SU - Single Use; a disposable motor which cannot be re-used.

Subsonic - A speed less than Mach 1.

Superroc - Usually, a lengthened version of an existing model rocket design, used in altitude and duration competition. Scoring is based on altitude multiplied by airframe length. Super-Roc has different length limits for different motor classes. For example; A has a range of 75 to 150 cm, C has a range of 125-250cm. The rockets can be longer but the excess length is not counted into the length factor. In the altitude category the rocket may be recovered in more than one section.

Supersonic - A speed greater than Mach 1 and less than Mach 5.

Sustainer - In a multi-stage rocket, the last or top stage. In a parallel staged rocket, the longest-burning motor.

Sweepback - The amount of angle that the leading edge of a wing has been shifted back from a line perpendicular to the airframe of a model.

Swing Test - A stability test in which a string is attached to a model rocket at the center of gravity and then swung around the head. If the model is stable, it will head nose into the direction of travel. This test has a large margin of error, thus producing models often overly stable. It can not be used for large rockets, unless King Kong consents to twirl the string. Sometimes called a string test.

Symmetrical Airfoil - An airfoil (wing) in which both the top and bottom surfaces are tapered.

Terminal Velocity - The highest allowed velocity for a shape or design, any further attempt to accelerate the object will result in drag forces completely eliminating the acceleration.

Theodolite - A device for determining altitude by measuring both elevation and azimuth angles. More accurate than a simple inclinometer, which measures only the elevation angle.

Thermal - A rotating column of rising air which forms over warm, flat terrain. Thermals can pose a problem for gliders and rockets on parachutes, since they can make them actually gain altitude when they should be descending.

Thermalite - A low-explosive device in the shape of narrow string, similar to detonation cord. Thermalite is often used to enhance the efficiency of igniters in large-diameter composite motors, and is sometimes used for airstarting motors. The possession and use of Thermalite now requires a LEUP to be issued from the BATF.

Throat - The narrowest cross-section of a rocket motors nozzle.

Thrust - The propulsive force developed by a rocket motor during the rockets powered ascent. The force produced by a rocket motor is described by Newtons second law of motion “Force equals mass times acceleration” and by Newtons third law of motion “for every acting force, there is an equal reacting force in the opposite direction.” The amount of forward thrust generated by a motor is defined by the second law (F=MXA), the third law merely says that it must move. In obedience to the second law, the two variables which must be known in predicting a motors thrust is the mass of exhaust gas expelled at any given moment, and the exhausts velocity.

Thrust Decay - The gradual loss of thrust at the end of a motors burn.

Thrust/Weight Ratio - The relationship between the thrust a rockets motor produces and the weight of the rocket at takeoff. Because hobby rockets do not normally use active stabilization, it is critical that the rocket develop sufficient speed by the time it leaves its launch rod so that the fins can keep it stable. (See Stability.) For this reason, it is normally recommended that a rockets thrust/weight ratio at takeoff should be at least 5/1. That is, a rocket that weighs eight ounces at takeoff should use a motor whose initial thrust is at least 40 ounces (2.5 pounds.)

Timer - An electronic device which is used to control events during a rockets flight, such as sustainer motor ignition or recovery system deployment. A timer is normally combined with another device such as an accelerometer or G-switch, which provides a start signal for the timer.

Tip Chord - The chord at the tip of a wing or fin. See Chord.

Tip-Off - An alteration of a rockets flight direction caused by interaction of the launcher, rocket, and wind direction as the rocket leaves the launcher.

T-Max - The time interval between ignition and maximum thrust.

Total Impulse - The total thrust produced by a rocket motor across its full burn time. Usually expressed in Newton-seconds.

TSTO - Two Stage To Orbit

TTMM - To The Motor Mount: An extension of TTW fin mounting, in which the fin tab which has passed through the airframe wall contacts the motor mount tube and is bonded there with epoxy.

TTW - Through The Wall; a technique for increasing the strength of a fin-to-airframe mounting joint. The airframe is slotted at the point where the fin is to be mounted. The fin is extended or tabbed so that it can pass through the body tube instead of bonding to its surface. Commonly the root of the fin bonds to the surface of the motor tube, then fillets are built up where the fin passes through the airframe.

Tube Fins - Tubes attached to the trailing end of a rocket airframe, used in place of fins.

Tube Launched - A rocket - often having some form of folding fins - which is supported at launch by a tube or box rather than by a launch rod or rail.

Tumble Recovery - A recovery method where a very light model rocket ejects its motor and shifts its CG behind the CP, thus preventing stable flight and causing the model to tumble end over end.

Tunnel - Slang for wind tunnel. Also, a long hollow conduit on the side of a rocket used to protect wiring traveling from the top to the bottom of the rocket.

Turbulator - A device used on rockets with conical cross-sections, such as egg lofters, to prevent the extra drag which occurs when the laminar airflow separates from the airframe. This is done by causing the airflow to become turbulent at the point where it would normally separate from the airframe.

Two-Stage Recovery - A process by which a rocket is recovered by means of a streamer or drogue parachute which opens at apogee, followed by a main parachute which opens at lower altitude. See Single-Stage Recovery.

### U
Ultrascale - The practice of building very large HPR versions of smaller model rockets, several times the size of the original.

Umbilical Mast - A mast extending beside a rocket while sitting on its launcher, designed to support wiring or hoses to the rocket. It is often designed to pull the wiring or hose out of the way once the models motors ignite.

Underwear Elastic - Flat elastic material, similar to that sewn into the waistbands of underwear, often used as shock cord in model rockets. A larger version is sometimes used in high power rockets.

Unsymmetrical Thrust - A condition in which the thrust of a motor or motor cluster is not parallel to the axis of the rocket. This is most often caused by the failure of part of a cluster of motors to ignite or a protuberance extending into the exhaust stream of a single motor.

Upscale - The practice of building large HPR versions of smaller model rockets.

### V
Vacu-form - A method of making lightweight plastic components like nose cones by using heated plastic, a mold, and a vacuum pump that is attached to the mold.

Wadding - A non-flammable filler material placed in a model rocket airframe before the parachute is inserted, and serving two purposes:

- To act as a piston for deployment charge gases
- To protect the parachute and other deployment system components from burning.

Waiver - A permission granted by the FAA to launch large rockets into airspace that it controls, for specific altitudes (usually 5000 or 10,000 feet) and for a specific period of time.

Weathercocking - The tendency of a rocket to fly into a breeze, altering the flight path from vertical.

Wedging - A method of securing fins by forcing the fin root in between tubes in a motor cluster.

Wind Tunnel - A specially designed pipe in which moving air can be channeled in a controlled way, producing an air stream of laminar flow and constant velocity, thus allowing testing of a design under constant conditions.

Wing - In British usage, a rockets fins. Also, the lifting surfaces of a glider.

Wing Loading - A method for measuring appropriate wing size, calculated by dividing the wing area in inches squared by the mass of the aircraft.

Winglets - Small fin or wing-like extensions attached to the ends of the wings of an aircraft.

Wood Grain - The predominant direction of the fibers in a piece of wood. important to note as the strength of the material is perpendicular to the fiber direction.

X-form - A parachute shape which looks like a cross instead of a circle from the top.

### Y
Yaw - A back-and-forth motion of the nose of a rocket in flight, on the axis determined as “left-and-right”. See Pitch.
