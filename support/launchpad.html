 Background

 The launch pad described in
this write-up is a adaptation/copy of a launcher that was described on the <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/archives/rec.models.rockets/">Sunsite</a>.
This launch pad was originally developed and described by Bill Owens in the
MARS (NAR Section 136) newsletter and reprinted on the Sunsite. &nbsp;A link to that article can be found here: <a href="http://metalab.unc.edu/pub/archives/rec.models.rockets/PLANS/launchpads/plumber.pad/">Plumbers Delight</a>.

 Construction

 The pad is basic and light
and consists primarily of 1 inch PVC pipe. &nbsp;Pickup the parts shown in Table 1 at your local hardware outlet. &nbsp;The part numbers listed are from Builders
Square, if you dont have one of them around, any Hardware or Plumbing outlet
should have equivalent parts.

 Take the 8 foot section of
pipe and cut four 2 inch sections of pipe with a hacksaw. &nbsp;Take the remaining pipe and cut four 23 inch
sections of pipe. &nbsp;After you are done
you should have about 2.5 inches of pipe left, youd could use this to protect
the launch rod attachment from motor exhaust or provide a spacer for the rocket
above the blast deflector. &nbsp;Take the 4
way pipe coupler and use PVC joint cleaning compound to get the joints ready to
join. &nbsp;Do the same to the 2 inch
sections you just cut. &nbsp;Coat the joints
according to the instructions on your PVC cement compound.&nbsp; Insert the 2 inch sections in each of the
four holes in the 4 way. &nbsp;Let that set
for as long as the instructions on the cement label suggest. &nbsp;Take the four 45 degree elbows and clean up
one of the ends and prepare them for gluing to the remainder of the 2 inch
sections that are sticking out of the 4 way. &nbsp;&nbsp;Test fit each of the 45 degree elbows and make sure they can all
be pushed completely on and make sure you can get them all lined up straight
down, before applying any glue. &nbsp;Use a
pencil to mark the best alignment on each if that will help keep them straight.
&nbsp;Apply the PVC cement and attach the 45
degree elbow with the ends facing directly down on each of the four ends. &nbsp;Make sure they are as straight as you can
make them and do it quickly, since the glue sets up rapidly.&nbsp; Take a 3/8 inch drill and drill a hole
directly through the top and bottom walls of the middle of the 4 way. &nbsp;You should have a set up that ends up looking
like Figure 1 when you are all done with this step.

The four 23 inch sections of pipe are the legs of the pad. &nbsp;Do not glue them into the base, as it makes
the unit more portable. &nbsp;If you want to
glue them on, be forewarned the footprint of this pad when assembled is quite
wide so be prepared to have lots of room in your trunk or van to take it.

 The method of rod
attachment differs from what is described in the previously mentioned article. &nbsp;An adaptation of what Bill described is shown
in Figure 2. &nbsp;Notice 2/3rds of a
turnbuckle is used and tapped a screw hole in the side to act as a lock screw
to hold the rod in place. &nbsp;That
arrangement worked fine for rockets up to C motors. When used with &nbsp;Ds, Es and heavier rockets, &nbsp;there was quite a bit of sag at the base of
the rod attachment and a lot of rod whip on launch. &nbsp;This lead to the following modification, Figure 3 shows the
modifications to the rod attachment.

 With this modification,
there is no ability to adjust the angle of the pad, but the result is a more
stable launcher. &nbsp;If you really want to
angle your rod, you can find a not so level piece of ground, or buy another 8
foot section of PVC pipe and cut two sets of two legs each shorter than the
first set (to make a 5 and 10 deg set up for example), or you could use a block
of 2x4 propped under two of the legs.

 The rod attachment uses a
threaded rod, 2 nuts, 2 washers and the 2 inch coupler. &nbsp;Take the coupler and drill 2 holes ¼ inch and
7/8 inch from the end (Figure 3). &nbsp;The
size of the hole is dependent upon the type of screw you use for locking the
rod in place.&nbsp; Two 10-32 thumb screws
are recommended, the drill recommended to tap a 10-32 screw is a #21 drill. &nbsp;Once youve drilled the holes tap them and
test the screws to make sure they are easy to turn.

 Assemble the combination as
shown in the drawing in Figure 3. &nbsp;The
blast deflector is a metal plate, placed between the coupler and the top nut.
If you use a thicker material like a floor tile, you will have to cut the
threaded rod longer to accommodate it. Figure 4 shows the assembled ¾ and 1
inch PVC pipe units ready to launch rockets.

 Mounting and assembly is
identical for both the ¾ and 1 inch version, the threaded rod on the larger pad
is ½ inch version which allows rods up to 3/8 inch.

 You should be able to put
the pad together in a couple of hours with normal hand tools. &nbsp;You may have to borrow a drill and tap. &nbsp;Combinations are sold in hardware stores for
$4.50. &nbsp;Its a handy tool to have so its
not a bad investment. &nbsp;Without the tap
you should be able to put this together for less than $10 (less if you have
launch rods from previous Estes pads).

 Summary

 This pad has been used for
rockets up to 2 lbs, equipped with G motors, and with rod sizes up to 3/8
inch.&nbsp; If this pad doesnt meet your
needs you may want to check out the Jan-Feb 99 issue of NARs Sport Rocketry,
there is a very good article on making a swivel head with a neat method of
attaching the rod with a drill chuck, adapting that to a camera tripod. &nbsp;There is also an article on making ablative
blast deflectors in the same issue.
