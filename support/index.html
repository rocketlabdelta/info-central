Introduction 
Critical to successful launching is good ground support equipment.  A suitably sized launch pad and an adequate firing console are necessary to get your project off the ground.
 
You will find information currently about commercially available launchers and firing consoles in the links to the left, as well as some modifications you can do to make them more convenient to use.  In the future, you will find information here on building your own launchers and firing consoles, as well as other items of ground support equipment designed to make launching more successful.
