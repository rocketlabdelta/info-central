A Simple Way to Protect Cluster Wires


Get a second centering ring that matches the ring in the back of the rocket,
and push it onto the motor mount protrusions. Make a few small holes in it
for the protruding ignitor wires, but run most of the wiring underneath
it (from wherever the wires come out) so that everything is protected by the
plywood. No chance of the wires charring!
