A Simple Way to Protect Cluster Wires

Get a second centering ring that matches the ring in the back of the rocket, and push it onto the motor mount protrusions. Make a few small holes in it for the protruding ignitor wires, but run most of the wiring underneath it (from wherever the wires come out) so that everything is protected by the plywood. No chance of the wires charring!
