 To light multiple motors at once, such as in a cluster, you need
a "clip whip."
You can make clip-whips for two, three, or four motors, more if you
dare.

For each ignitor, you will need:
 <ul>
<li>2 copper micro-clips (with flat jaws; they grip ignitors better than
alligator clips); Radio Shack sells these in packets.
</li><li>A length of 20 or 22 gauge 2-conductor speaker wire. I use the kind
with one copper and one nickel lead in clear plastic insulation. &nbsp;The
exact length is not important, 10-18" is good; &nbsp;all whips in a set should
be about equal. Because this is a small gauge of wire, excessive length is
excessive resistance.
</li><li>Solder.
</li></ul>
I use "match-point" or "tape" solder, which can be melted
in a match flame. (Heat the wire in the flame and slowly add solder by touching
it to the hot part so that it melts into the connection.) If you have a soldering
iron, then use what suits you.
 
Split each end of each lead about 2" at each end, and strip about
1/2" of insulation off every wire end. Refer to the illustration above.
&nbsp;Crimp and solder a pair of micro-clips on one end of each set. &nbsp;Then
gather all the loose copper ends; twist and solder together. &nbsp;Do the
same with all the loose nickel ends.

Using Them
 
On the pad, hook a pair of micro-clips to each ignitor. &nbsp;(If there are
more leads than ignitors, such as if you are firing a two-engine cluster
with a three-lead clip whip, just make sure the extra set does not short
out.) &nbsp;Hook your regular launch system clips to the free twisted, soldered
ends. &nbsp;Countdown and launch!
