<P>
<b>Finishing Up!</b>
<br>This article is about getting the best possible paint job using a spray
can. First, make sure you have everything you need before you start and read
the <B>Paint Prep.</B> article.

<p><b>Particle Masks</b>
<br><img SRC="images/spraycan_dust_mask.jpg" BORDER=0 height=60 width=66>
<p>This is an essential if you want to live a long time and chase lots
of rockets.

<p><b>Dusting Materials</b>
<br><img SRC="images/spraycan_duster.jpg" BORDER=0 height=100 width=82>

<p>Hopefully the rocket is clean, free from dust and grease. A blow
gun or can of air is nice to get rid of the dust from the nooks and 
crannies.&nbsp;
Dusting should be done before priming and after sanding of the primer prior
to finishing.
<p>Once it is well dusted, run a tack rag over the entire airframe, NC
and fin can just to pick up any stray debris.
<p><img SRC="images/spraycan_tackrag.gif" BORDER=0 height=108 width=160>
<p><b>Jigging Materials, A proper place to spray the part, A proper place
to dry the painted part</b>
<p>Are all necessary at this point. See "Starting to Finish" for
more details
<p><b>Primers and Paints</b>
<p>This details the use of spray cans for priming and painting. While
other systems are available to the rocketeer like airbrushes, conventional
guns, and HVLP air or turbine systems, most of us will use rattle cans
to paint their beauties.
<p>A good rattlecan is like the Holy Grail of painting. Some prefer
Krylon, some go for Rustoleum, some get their materials from Wal-Mart in
whatever happens to be on sale at the moment.
<p>When choosing a good spray can the essentials are:
<UL>
<LI>Type of Resin and Vehicle
<LI>Availability in the correct color
<LI>Final Appearance
<LI>Drying Time
<LI>Ease of Use
</UL>
<p><b>Type of Resin and Vehicle</b> is important because it often dictates
how quickly additional coats can be installed. One brand may melt, wrinkle
and lift another brand so read the labels and make notes, mental or 
otherwise.&nbsp;
It also indicates the quality of finish that can be expected, the ultimate
durability of the finish coat, the odor, and the ease of use. Always
try and test on a scrap or on a masked area of the rocket.
<p><b>Availability</b> is pretty self-explanatory.
<p><b>Final Appearance</b> is the look and feel of the material once 
installed.&nbsp;
Some finishes look cheap and 2 dimensional while some look lustrous with
an inner depth. Testing by spraying a couple of samples is the easiest
way to determine this. (though there are factors like "pigment volume
concentration" and the type and quality of resins involved that can be
used to determine finish before application)
<p><b>Drying time</b> is important as this determines when the part is
dust-free and unlikely to pick up stray contamination that might be floating
around. Always test for dryness by touching an area that has been
masked and not the part itself. Drying time also determines how quickly
the part can be repainted and how long it will hold a wet edge. 
Repainting
is best done in rapid succession, that is the part is painted and repainted
until the depth of color is achieved, all in one session. Waiting an hour
or two between coats can often have disastrous effects and itís best to
wait weeks before installing additional finish coats.
<p><b>Ease of use</b> is merely that. Some products spray better
than others!&nbsp; Cheap nozzles, coarsely ground pigments and solids,
low internal pressure, solvent type all make for a good spraying experience
or a poor one. This can also vary from color to color within a 
manufacturers
spectrum. Experimentation is the only way to determine all these
factors.
<p><b>Primers - Special Considerations</b>
<p>The above factors are applicable to both primers and finishes though
primers have a couple of additional requirements. Many times a good
paint job is a result of superior priming and preparation. If the
primer looks lousy there is no way the rocket is going to look any 
better.&nbsp;
Not only must a primer exhibit the previously mentioned characteristics
of spray paints but also:
<UL>
<LI>Compatibility
<LI>Adhesion
<LI>Opacity
<LI>Build
<LI>Ease of Sanding
<LI>Whiteness
</UL>
<p><b>Compatibility</b> is first and foremost. It has to work under
subsequent finish coats and on the part you
<br>are coating. This can be determined if you know the components
of the primer and finish or by
<br>experimenting. Make sure that the primer won't damage the part and
be absolutely positive that the
<br>finish will not lift, soften or wrinkle the primer.
<p><b>Adhesion</b> is how the primer adheres to the part or parts.&nbsp;
A primer might stick like crazy to paper but will fall off G10 or plastic
if you look at it funny. This can only be determined through 
experimentation.&nbsp;
The general test for adhesion is to prime and allow a test piece to dry.&nbsp;
Scratch an "X" into the surface of the part and lay a piece of masking
tape over the X. Burnish the tape into the surface well with your
thumbnail, then pull the tape off. If smaller bits of primer come
loose on the tape, then you have a problem and a different primer must
be chosen.
<p><b>Opacity</b> is how completely covered the part becomes with one 
application
of primer. Generally, the more opaque the finish, the faster the
job is done. It is a function of pigments and solids, often a primer
will use cheap pigments like talc or silica where the more expensive finishes
use titanium dioxide. The higher the grade of pigments, the greater
the opacity.
<p><b>Build</b> is the rate at which the solids stack up on top of each
other with every pass of the spraycan. To fill voids, pinholes, creases,
sanding marks a primer has to fill or build rapidly. The more solids
by volume the greater the rate of build.
<p><b>Ease of Sanding</b> is the rate at which the primer sands off the
rocket. A good primer should powder up and sand off rapidly without
clogging the sandpaper. This is often difficult to find in a spray
primer as they generally are not intended to be sanded, merely sprayed
on then sprayed over with a finish.
<p>Absolute <b>Whiteness</b> is the best bet for this type of spray 
primer.&nbsp;
Using a gray or red primer doesnít make much sense to me since most colors
generally look the best when applied over a vivid white base. This
is a personal opinion, of course. Attempting to paint yellow, red,
light colors, or fluorescents over any color besides white is often an
exercise in futility. The darker colors and black cover so well on
their own it doesnít make sense to use a colored primer. Same thing
holds true for metallics, they generally cover so well in one or two 
applications
that the white primer issue is moot.
<p>My favorite is a product manufactured by Zynolite called "Stain 
Killer".&nbsp;&nbsp;
It exhibits all the characteristics I've outlined above and is relatively
inexpensive as well. CoverStain by Zinsser is pretty good too but
not as good as the Zynolite product. Peter Alway suggests Dutch Boy
flat white as a primer, either he has stock in the company or a 10 year
supply of it. Some swear by KilZ, some insist on gray automotive
primer, some use red oxide and struggle with recoating. Look for
the Zynolite "Stain Killer" though, you'll be very pleased. Zynolite
is an ITC company.
<p><img SRC="images/spraycan_coverstain.gif" BORDER=0 height=107 width=80>
<p>Pigmented shellac primers are okay but don't sand very well, B-I-N by
Zinsser is a good example of this. They spray out of the can very
fast though, be careful!
<p><img SRC="images/spraycan_bin1.gif" BORDER=0 height=100 width=75>
<p>Clear shellacs make an excellent barrier coat if you find your finish
is wrinkling the primer or previous coats of paint. The shellac prevents
the finish coat solvents from attacking the coats underneath. Often
times when sanding, cutting the film allows solvent to sneak between the
dried film on the top and the uncured film underneath. At these minute
cut lines, you will often see lines of wrinkles spreading out into the
film. This means often means trouble.
<p><img SRC="images/spraycan_shellac.jpg" BORDER=0 height=140 width=125>
<p>Waterborne primers are generally difficult to sand and runny.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>&nbsp;
<p><b>So what is the best spray can paint for finishing?</b>
<p>Sheen is an important starting point. A high gloss will show all
the defects a rocket has. A lower gloss, generally called a "Satin"
or "Eggshell" finish will hide a lot of mistakes while still giving a nice
look. Flat should be reserved for scale or military rockets, or for
vehicles that are total beaters flown only in hopes they might be lost.
<p>For whites and blacks I have found some good lacquer-base materials
in spray cans. Lacquers are nice in that they dry extremely fast,
available in gloss and satin. This stuff is great for scale rockets
and missiles.
<p>Some like <A HREF="http://www.krylon.com/main.html">Krylon</A>:
<br><img SRC="images/spraycan_krylon.gif" BORDER=0 height=150 width=52>
<p>Personally, I buy the store label from Orchard Supply and Hardware or
OSH. They may be available on the east coast but I donít know, itís
owned by Sears. Inexpensive, great finish, fast drying time, lots
of colors but your mileage may vary.
<p><img SRC="images/spraycan_osh-logo.gif" BORDER=0 height=35 width=123>
<p>In other words, there is no best spray can paint for finishing.&nbsp;
Experimentation on your part will be the major determining factor.
<p><b>Technique</b>
<p>The best and most expensive can of spray paint will result in the absolute
worst finish if the paint is not applied properly. Take care that
the cans are warm, the paint is well shaken, and the nozzle sprays in an
even pattern. Salvage good nozzles from dead spray cans and store
them for later use.
<p>This assumes that the part you are painting is jigged and ready to go,
you have adequate protection for overspray, you have a light handy to sidelight
your work and you have a place to put the part once painted. If not,
see "Starting to Finish".
<p>Test the spray can on a piece of paper taped to the wall, check the
pattern. Discard the nozzle or soak if it doesnít look right.&nbsp;
See how the paint lays down once sprayed. Wait a bit and see if it
runs, spray back over it once itís tacked up a bit and see how the overspray
lines react to the painted surface. This will tell you how you have
to proceed to get the best looking job.
<p><b>Holding the spray can</b>
<p><img SRC="images/spraycan_spray_distance.jpg" BORDER=0 height=236 width=340>
<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold like 
This&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Not like This
<p>Pretend this is a spray can rather than a spray gun, I couldn't steal
a good spray can graphic off the net anywhere!&nbsp; Try to hold it as
perpendicular to the part as possible. Also, remember to spray away
from your work, the material you've just laid down, as you paint.&nbsp;
This involves pointing the can slightly off perpendicular and away from
the fresh paint. If the can or gun is pointed back into the work
then dry spray or overspray will settle onto the painted surface causing
it to look chalky, sandy or fuzzy.
<p>This first pass is called a "tack coat". The purpose is not to
cover the whole airframe, rather to get about 50% coverage on the part,
then allow it to tack up. This allows subsequent coats of paint something
to hang onto.
<p>Starting with the aft end, spray the motor mount and the trailing edges
of the fins.
<p>Next spray the tip chord and leading edge of the fins.
<p>Holding the rocket from the aft end, point the forward end down and
spray the face of all the fins, rotating the airframe as you go.
<p>Spray the area between the fins, rotating the airframe, pointing the
nozzle away from the finished fins and towards the nose cone end of the
rocket.
<p>Spray the airframe, again pointing the nozzle towards the NC rotating
the airframe as you go. Work up the airframe until you are at the
nosecone end. Allow this tack coat time to partially dry, test for
dryness by touching a masked portion of the rocket.
<p>While you are waiting for it to dry, put a tack coat on the nosecone.&nbsp;
Remember, if you paint your nosecone black, youíre asking for trouble when
it gets hot. It wonít come off when the ejection charge blows since
the summer sun has expanded it within the airframe!&nbsp; Trust me on this
one. Allow the nosecone to tack up.
<p>Go back to the airframe and repeat the above steps. If the paint
starts to look funny, consult the troubleshooting table below and take
the steps necessary.
<p>If everything looks okeedokee, repeat the steps until you have complete
coverage and you are satisfied with the appearance. If you try to
cover up imperfections in one application, "loading up the paint", you
will often be rewarded with a sag or run. Itís much better to do
numerous applications of light coats of paint, as youíve often read on
the label of every single can ever sold. Itís true.
<p>If you spend lots of time turning the cans upside-down to clear the
paint from the nozzle put the paint clogged nozzles onto a can of GumOut
carb cleaner, allow to sit, then spray a little into a rag.Voila! a perfectly
clean nozzle every time. Give it a shot! It works great and you don't
loose all of the can's propellant.
