<P><B>Summary</B></P>

<P>This article describes the role of various federal agencies relevant to
the storage, shipment, and use of motors for sport rocketry.  The storage,
shipment, and use of motors for sport rocketry are regulated by a variety
of Federal agencies, in addition to any state and local agencies you may
have to deal with. Understanding the various regulations is important for
two reasons: It helps ensure that you won&#146;t accidentally violate a
regulation (which in the worst case scenario could have serious
consequences) and it may help you make a persuasive case for local
authorities, who may wish to be more restrictive than the law requires.</P>

<P><B>The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)</B></P>

<P>The CPSC regulates the sale of toy propellant devices, which includes
small rocket motors. They are responsible for age requirements for
purchasers of larger motors. </P>

<P><B>The Department of Transportation </B></P>
 
<P>The DOT regulates the shipment of hazardous materials, including rocket
motors of all types, in interstate commerce. The DOT works on an exemption
basis: The way it works is that the shipment of all hazardous materials,
including rocket motors, is forbidden, unless an exemption is granted by
the DOT. A manufacturer wanting to ship a motor must therefore submit it to
DOT, where it is evaluated and an exemption number, or EX number, is
given. The EX number is issued in a letter which states how the material is
classified, and the rules applicable to its shipment. Manufacturers may ask
for additional relief, so that for example the DOT may approve the shipment
of a substance normally classified as an explosive as if it were merely a
flammable solid, provided specific quantity limits and packaging
instructions are met. The typical sport rocketry enthusiast is not likely
to run afoul of DOT regulations when driving around with motors in their
car trunk, unless they are engaged in transporting experimental motors
which have not been issued an EX number. </P>

<P>However, knowledge of the EX number system and the applicable DOT
shipment regulations <I>is</I> necessary in order to properly ship motors
using the Postal Service, UPS, or other carrier. Rocket motors must never
be loaded onto a passenger carrying airliner, either in checked baggage or
in carry on luggage. Many motors <I>can</I> be shipped using the Postal
Service, provided that the package is properly marked and documented. If
you have cause to send a motor back to a manufacturer, call and ask for
instructions&#150;many will send shipping materials to you that are
designed to keep everyone compliant with the applicable regulations.</P>

<P><B>The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms</B></P>

<P>The BATF regulates the use of explosive materials, including
storage. Further, if the material is acquired in interstate commerce, the
users themselves must have an appropriate BATF permit. While the rules may
enable you to launch rockets legally without this permit, if you are
careful about what you launch and where you buy it, you must comply with
BATF requirements for storage regardless.</P>

<P>The regulations
(<A HREF="http://www.atf.treas.gov/core/regulations/27cfr55.html">http://www.atf.treas.gov/core/regulations/27cfr55.html</A>)
in this area changed in December 2000, but unfortunately, (or perhaps
fortunately) the rule change was botched and the new regulations are
currently not being enforced with regard to rocket motors, pending another
formal rule-making process. The primary reason for the confusion is that
the system for classifying hazardous materials is changing worldwide, and
the BATF didn&#146;t get all the details right. But <I>you</I> may need to
know the details, both because the new rules are likely to get it right
next time, and because it is very possible that you will encounter the same
issues in dealing with your local authorities. The BATF regulations can be
found in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), Title 27, Part 55, which in
shorthand is written 27 CFR 55. These regulations are officially used by
BATF to interpret the public law (91-452) which requires them to regulate
explosives.</P>

<P>The primary issue is, "What is covered by BATF regulations?" It used to
be the case that a lot of rocket motors were not. <I>Prior to 12/98</I>,
The BATF regulations, in. 27 CFR 55.141, which covers Exemptions, included
in (a) (7)</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The importation and distribution of fireworks classified as Class C
explosives and generally known as "common fireworks", and other Class C
explosives, as described by U.S. Department of Transportation regulations
in 49 CFR 173.100 (p), (r), (t), (u) and (x)."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>In the regulations referred to by 27 CFR 55.141 (a) (7), the DOT's 49
CFR 173.100 (u) is about toy propellant devices, defined broadly enough to
include rocket motors using both cardboard and composite casings.</P>

<P>The BATF in 27 CFR 55.11 had already defined "Common Fireworks" as:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Any small firework device designed to produce visible effects by
combustion and which must comply with the construction, chemical
composition, and labeling regulations of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety
Commission, as set forth in Title 16, Code of Federal Regulations, parts
1500 and 1507. Some small devices designed to produce audible effects are
included, such as whistling devices, ground devices containing 50 mg or
less of explosive materials, and aerial devices containing 130 mg or less
of explosive materials. Common fireworks are classified as Class C
explosives by the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT). 49 CFR
173.100(r)."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>So, before 12/22, if US CPSC regulated it, and/or DOT regulated it as a
toy propellant device, it was exempted from regulation by BATF. </P>
However, DOT has been adopting a more refined classification of hazardous
materials and is also adopting the United Nation&#146;s standard for
classifying hazardous materials, which used to regulate world-wide
shipments. Whereas explosives used to be classified as Class A, Class B, or
Class C, along with a bunch of wordy definitions such as the one for
"Common Fireworks" above, they are now classified in much greater detail,
using a system of UN numbers as well as a set of numeric classes and
compatibility groups. The new numeric classes designate the kinds of bad
things that can happen when things go wrong in shipment, and the UN numbers
describe the material itself.</P>

<P>For example, small BP and composite motors both used to be simply called
Class C explosives. BP motors are now classified as UN0432, Class 1.4S,
whereas Small (&lt;30g) composite single use became UN0349 1.4S. There are
lots additional classifications for various sizes and types of motors. See
Table 1 for a list of applicable UN numbers, and Tables 2 through 5 for how
they apply to many of the current motor manufacturers.</P>

<P>When the system was first being used, there was a tendency to treat the
new classifications just like the old ones. Aerotech has a letter from the
DOT on their site, for example, issuing EX numbers for RMS kits and
designating them UN0351 1.4C. And, "to facilitate translation to the UN
system," the DOT helpfully adds the translation "Toy Propellant
Devices."</P> <P>So, before 12/98, these RMS kits were classified by DOT in
a way that exempted them from regulation by BATF [because of the reference
by BATF to DOT's 49 CFR 173.100 (u) and their own definition of Common
Fireworks]. </P>

<P>Then BATF changed the rules.  First, they deleted the definition of
Common Fireworks in the rules that became effective 12/98. Instead, they
substituted "Consumer Fireworks" which sounded a lot like the earlier
definition EXCEPT that it lists specific UN numbers&#150;in this case
UN0336 and UN0337&#150;instead of the more general Class C
explosives. Neither UN0336 and UN0337 are relevant to rocketry, and in fact
are used for materials classified as 1.4G. This is important for some
states that regulate materials by class instead of specific UN
number&#150;for example, you may have much more of a problem complying with
local standards for 1.4G than you do for 1.4S, which is what Estes motors
are. Materials classified as 1.4G may be banned as fireworks!</P>

<P>BATF also changed our key exemption clause, 27 CFR 55.141 (a) (7), to exempt only:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The importation, distribution, and storage of fireworks classified as
UN0336, UN0337, UN0431, or UN0432 explosives by the U.S. Department of
Transportation at 49 CFR 172.101 and generally known as "consumer
fireworks" or "articles pyrotechnic."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>UN0336 and UN0337 are for fireworks. UN0431 and UN0432 are "articles
pyrotechnic." UN0432 in particular is the designation given by the DOT to
small black powder rocket motors, so Estes and Quest are still
exempt. However, none of the UN numbers used for composite propellant
motors were included, even for those classified as 1.4S, just like Estes
motors are. This is apparently not what the BATF intended.</P>

<P>As a result, a letter
(http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com/customersite/resource_library/RegulatoryDocuments/ATF/letter_from_atf_1-13-99.pdf)
was issued on 1/5/99 to BATF Division Directors acknowledging the error and
directing that, pending a new rule making process, no enforcement action be
taken regarding the importation, distribution, and storage of a list of
explosives including:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
"Model rocket motors classified by the U.S. Department of Transportation at
49 CFR 172.101 as UN0349, UNO351, UN0471, NA0276, or NA0323; consisting of
ammonium perchlorate composite propellant, black powder, or other similar
low explosives; containing no more than 62.5 grams propellant weight; and
designed as single use motors or as reload kits."
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Note that there has been some vagueness about the use of 62.5g of
propellant criterion in the past. Aerotech complies with the law to the
letter in shipping reload kits with multiple grains each less than
62.5g. The reason some of the grains in those kits are wrapped in
additional layers of plastic is that from the DOT&#146;s perspective, the
larger package contains several reload "kits." It appears that the BATF
intends to regulate these reloads based on the motor they are designed to
go into, not the size of the individual grains.</P>

<P>At present, we are back to the status quo as far as the BATF
goes. However, you can bet that the NPRM will not be as vague as the DOT
about the definition of a model rocket motor reload kit containing no more
than 62.5 grams of propellant weight. It appears that BATF wants to exempt
UN0432, UN0349, UN0471, for sure. It appears that they would like to
regulate UN0186, UN0275, and those UN0351 reload kits that are intended to
be assembled into a motor with more than 62.5 grams of propellant weight,
regardless of the weight or packaging of individual grains. Here they would
be in some degree of conflict with DOT, which permits UN0351 to be shipped
around in 20 pound boxes as if it were flammable solid. There is also talk
of permitting some sort of Sport Rocketry permit, with a break on the cost
and maybe even a break on the storage requirements. Time will tell.</P>

<P><B>Appendix: Excerpts from the DOT&#146;s Explosive Classification system</B></P>

<P>&nbsp;173.50(a) Explosive. For the purpose of this subchapter, an
explosive means any substance or article, including a device, which is
designed to function by explosion (i.e., an extremely rapid release of gas
and heat) or which, by chemical reaction within itself, is able to function
in a similar manner even if not designed to function by explosion, unless
the substance or article is otherwise classed under the provision of this
subchapter.</P>

<P>173.50(b) Explosives in Class 1 are divided into six divisions as follows:</P>
<UL>

<LI>173.50(b)(3) Division 1.3 consists of explosives that have a fire
hazard and either a minor blast hazard or a minor projection hazard or
both, but not a mass explosion hazard.

<LI>173.50(b)(4) Division 1.4 consists of explosives that present a minor
explosion hazard. The explosive effects are largely confined to the package
and no projection of fragments of appreciable size or range is to be
expected. An external fire must not cause virtually instantaneous explosion
of almost the entire contents of the package.

<LI>173.51 Authorization to offer and transport explosives.
<BR>173.51(a) Unless otherwise provided in this subpart, no person may offer for
transportation or transport an explosive, unless it has been tested and
classed and approved by the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials
Safety (&#167;173.56).

<LI>173.51(b) Reports of explosives approved by the Department of Defense
or the Department of Energy must be filed with, and receive acknowledgement
in writing by, the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety
prior to such explosives being offered for transportation.

<LI>173.52 Classification codes and compatibility groups of explosives.
<BR>173.52(a) The classification code for an explosive, which is assigned
by the Associate Administrator for Hazardous Materials Safety in accordance
with this subpart, consists of the division number followed by the
compatibility group letter. Compatibility group letters are used to specify
the controls for the transportation, and storage related thereto, of
explosives and to prevent an increase in hazard that might result if
certain types of explosives were stored or transported
together. Transportation compatibility requirements for carriers are
prescribed in &#167;&#167;174.81, 175.78. 176.83 and 177.848 of this
subchapter for transportation by rail, air, vessel, and public highway,
respectively, and storage incidental thereto.
