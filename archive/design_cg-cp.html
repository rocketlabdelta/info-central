The CG (Center of Gravity) and CP (Center of Pressure) are very important
fundamental design and flight parameters of any rocket, and have an
important relationship to each other. The general relationship between the
CG and CP is as follows: the center of pressure must be a minimum of 1 body
diameter BEHIND the center of gravity on a rocket fully prepped for launch
to ensure stability. Now we’ll explain why it must be this way, and what you
can do to make sure your rocket meets this requirement, whether it’s a kit
or a scratchbuilt design.
<P>
You're probably aware of the center of gravity (CG); this is the point on a
rocket (or any object) where all the weight seems to be "centered". The
center of pressure (CP) is similar; it is the point on the rocket where the
corrective force of the fins is "centered". OK, now imagine just a simple
stick, a piece of dowel 12” long. This is your “rocket”, with one end the
nose end and the other the motor end. It weighs the same on the first 6” as
it does on the rear 6”; that’s why the CG is exactly in the middle at 6”.
That’s what the CG means, where the weight (or, more correctly, mass) of the
item is centered. Now, drive an imaginary nail into your stick “rocket” into
the table it’s sitting on right at that CG point of 6”. OK, now push on the
front of the rocket, and it spins right at the nail, the CG. Push on the
rear of the rocket, and it spins right at the nail, the CG. That’s a good
way to think of the CG…it’s the “nail” that your real rocket will turn
around in flight.
<P>
Now, think about if you put fins on the back end of your stick (rocket).
Though it’s not completely true, say that the CP is exactly where you stuck
the fins on your rocket (it’s true enough for this example). If that stick
was flying through the air front end first, and wind pushes on the rocket,
the fins will push on the stick. The stick will rotate around the “nail”/CG.
Since the fins are on the back, the rocket straightens back out and
continues nose forward. Now remove your imaginary fins from the back of the
rocket and put them only on the front near the “nose cone” end of your
rocket. OK, now it’s flying again, and wind pushes on the fins; push on the
fins of your imaginary rocket. What happens? The nose of the rocket turns
around the “nail”/CG, and the front end flips over and turns into the rear
end. This is bad! Of course, you want the front end of the rocket to stay
the front! That’s the general reason why the CG must be ahead of the CP…
keeping the CP behind the CG makes sure the front of the rocket stays the
front!
<P>
Many manufacturers specify the CP location on their kits. CP doesn't vary in
kit rockets, it's controlled by the design of the kit. CP is affected by
such things as the rocket’s body diameter, length of body, fin size, number
of fins, and fin placement on the body tube. CP can’t be changed in kits.
However, you CAN vary CG, by adding more nose weight. That's why the kit
manufacturers specify CP, so the owner of the rocket can find their CG and
compare it against the CP to see if they need to add some nose weight (to
move the CG ahead of the CP) for stability.
<P>
The CG will be dependent upon how you build and use the rocket, which is why
manufacturers usually don't specify CG. Some people really use a bunch of
epoxy, others don't. It's variable enough on how the person builds the
rocket, but even more so as what type of payload you have (if any). You can
imagine that given the same kit design, if someone were carrying some
complex and heavy video electronics that the CG would be dramatically
different from someone who flies no payload at all.
<P>
Once a kit is built and ready to fly (with payload), CG location is most
dependent on the motors used. Of course a G motor is much lighter than an I
motor, but a certain kit may be able to use G’s, H’s, and I’s. The motor is
obviously in the back of the rocket, and weight in the back of the rocket
shifts the CG rearward, so the bigger (heavier) the motor, the worse the
CG/CP relationship will be. Remember, CP doesn’t change…any weight added to
the rear of the rocket will move the CG back (bad), and weight added to the
front of the rocket will move the CG forward (good).
<P>
Mark the CP on the rocket, then mark a point at least one body diameter
ahead of the CP. Make sure you prep the rocket as it'll be in flight (with
the motor you intend to use installed, chute(s) installed, payload
installed, etc.) before you do the CG/CP check. No need to add black powder
to an altimeter or the delay area of a reload casing, or to put in igniters;
they’re not heavy enough to matter. Now balance the rocket "teeter-totter
style" on a piece of dowel, back of a chair, something like that. If the
rocket balances level with the pivot point of the teeter-totter arrangement
at or forward of the CG point you marked, you’re good to go! If not, you’ll
have to add nose weight until it does.
<P>
Up to two body diameters is usually even better, but don’t go much over two
diameters or the rocket will be overstable. By the way, this is what’s meant
by “one-caliber” or “two-caliber” stability. It comes from wartime artillery
terminology, where the diameter of a gun is called the “caliber”, so
“one-caliber” = one diameter, and so on. Don't forget that if you use, say,
a small H motor and set the CG, that if you then decide to use a big J
motor, the J weighs more and you may have to add nose weight again to
compensate. That’s why it’s usually recommended to set the CG/CP
relationship with the largest motor you intend to use in the rocket.
<P>
If you don’t have the biggest motor you intend to fly on hand, or if you
haven’t reached a certification level where you can buy one, check out the
weight of the propellant you intend to use and the reload casing from the
manufacturer. Many times that information is available on the manufacturer’s
web site. Simulate the weight of the casing and propellant in the motor
mount tube. Use one or more rolls of coins, a baggie with dirt in it,
whatever you can come up with that's similar to the weight of the motor and
casing.
