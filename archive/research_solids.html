All solid propellant contains at least two components -- an oxidizer and a
fuel.  Chemically speaking, the oxidizer accepts electrons, the fuel
supplies them.  In double-base propellants, oxidizer and fuel are contained
within the same molecule.  A common double-base propellant is
nitrocellulose (smokeless powder) plasticized with nitroglycerin.  There is
little amateur experimentation with double-base propellant, for obvious
reasons.

<P>
Blackpowder (typically 75% potassium nitrate oxidizer, 15% charcoal, 10%
sulfur) is still used for small motors, and has some desirable
characteristics.  It is quite cheap and has a high burn rate suitable for
endburning motors.  It can be "toned down" for coreburning motors.
However, it has a fairly low specific impulse of about 80 seconds (meaning
that one pound of the propellant configured to produce one pound of thrust
will burn for 80 seconds).  Blackpowder motors are made by pressing the
ingredients into the paper casing at ca. 1 ton/sq.in., which gives many
amateurs pause.  And blackpowder is much more sensitive to spark and
consequent accidental ignition than some other solid propellants.

<P>
Some amateurs work with potassium nitrate-sugar mixtures, sometimes
referred to as "candy" propellant.  The mixture is usually melted at a low
temperature.  Candy propellant has higher specific impulse than
blackpowder, up to 130-140 seconds.  Its burn rate is slower than that of
blackpowder, but is still fast enough to be used in coreburning motors.
Richard Nakka's site http://members.aol.com/ricnakk/index.html gives a very
comprehensive description of this and related propellants.

<P>
Composite propellant is made using a rubbery binder-fuel (sometimes just
called a binder) and a granular oxidizer.  As the name implies, the
binder-fuel holds the propellant together and also acts as a fuel.  Like
epoxy glue, a binder-fuel has two ingredients that, when mixed, harden into
a rubbery mass.

<P>
To prepare the propellant, the resin part of the binder-fuel is mixed with
the oxidizer and other solid ingredients.  The curative part of the
binder-fuel is then added, the mixture is packed, poured or extruded into
paper tubes or directly into the motor, and the mixture is then cured
(sometimes at elevated temperatures).  A core may be formed before curing
or drilled/cut after curing.

<P>
Most rocketeers who experiment with solid propellant, work with composite
propellant, as it is fairly simple to make and presents less danger from
accidental ignition than does blackpowder.

<P>
The most commonly-used oxidizer in composite propellant may be ammonium
perchlorate, NH4ClO4, also known as AP (composite propellant is sometimes
-- erroneously -- referred to as AP).  AP produces the highest practical
specific impulse obtained for typical experimental propellant, 140-250
seconds or so.  It is relatively simple to use, ignites easily, has a
reasonable burn rate, does not require a burn rate catalyst or a thermic
agent, and is nonhygroscopic.  Many AP compositions burn well only under
pressure, and the motor must be designed to take this into account.  The
burn rate of most AP compositions means that they are best suited to
coreburning, rather than endburning, motors.

<P>
Ammonium nitrate (AN) is another oxidizer sometimes used in experimental
motors.  AN compositions have lower specific impulse than comparable AP
compositions.  AN propellant is also less dense than AP propellant.  A 29mm
motor 10" long that uses AP propellant would likely be a full-H impulse
motor.  With AN propellant it is likely to be a low-H or even high-G motor.
AN propellant generally requires higher solids loading, around 80% for
proper operation than does AP propellant.  Either a burn rate catalyst
(speeds the burn rate; ammonium dichromate) or a thermic agent (most
commonly magnesium) is required; however, AN propellant still burns more
slowly (0.1"/sec) than most AP compositions (0.3"/sec).  AN undergoes a
phase change that can render a propellant unuseable from temperature
cycling over time, however, this is not a major concern for propellant that
will be properly stored and used within a few days or weeks.  AN is very
hygroscopic and propellant containing it must be prepared and stored under
low-humidity conditions.  It is quite cheap and readily available in many
US localities, though it may require recrystallization and milling for
propellant use.  Phase-stabilized AN, already milled to size and suitable
for propellant use, is available from CP Technologies.

<P>
Other oxidizers are used by the experimental rocketry community, but not as
commonly as are AP or AN.
