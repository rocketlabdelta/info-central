<P>
In my never-ending cloning/upscaling efforts I had a need to venture beyond
the straight body tube.  I needed a lightweight material that could be
carved and that could be glued together to create variable thickness and
length.  I remembered a foam insulation product called Foamular.  It's a
high-density foamboard product that can be cut, sawed, hot wire cut,
sanded, and is very lightwieght.  This foamboard product available at most
major home improvement and lumber stores in thickness of 2" to 5", and
either in 2' x 8' or 4' x 8' sheets.  The following is about my first
rocketry project made with Foamular.

<P>

<P><B>CREATE THE FOAM CORE</B>

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>
<TR VALIGN=top>
<TD>
First in this project I ripped on the tablesaw two pieces of Foamular that
measured 2" thick x 4" wide and 4' feet long and glued these together with
a thin layer of DAP Panel and Foamboard Adhesive. This glue comes in a
caulking tube and is available at most hardware stores. This gave me a core
that measured 4" thick, 4" wide, and 4 feet long. I allowed the core to dry
overnight and then trimmed the corners off at 45 degrees on the tablesaw to
match a 4" circle to save work.  This gave me an eight sided octagon shaped
core to work with
<I>
CAUTION: The Foamular is solvent sensitive and will
melt and give off toxic fumes if solvent glues, adhesives, epoxies, and
fillers are used! Use only solvent free glues, epoxies, and fillers on this
foam. Test small pieces first to see how the foam reacts before trying any
other adhesives or fillers on larger areas.

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>
<TR VALIGN=top>
<TD>
Next I decided to make the motor mount and recovery sections before carving
so I could take advantage of the flat surfaces left on the core. Before
cutting any sections make alignment reference marks across each section to
be cut. I cut two 8" sections off of the rear end of the rocket with the
tablesaw marking each section to its mate. The rear 8" section became the
motor mount section; the forward 8" section became the recovery/ parachute
section.  I next drilled out the two 8" sections to fit a BT-60 body tube
using a 1 5/8" hole saw. This hole was very snug so I sanded the inside to
fit using a 1/2" dowel and 150-grit sandpaper.  Next I cut two 12"sections
of BT-60 to be glued into the two drilled sections.  Cover one end of each
of the 12" BT-60 tube with masking tape and push it through pre-glued hole
(DAP adhesive), past the tape and set aside to dry. After the glue has
dried cut the BT-60 off flush with the foam. Glue the forward recovery
section back onto the upper core. Next lightly tack glue the recovery and
motor mount sections together for the carving process.  These sections will
be separated after the carving and sanding process is complete.

<P><B>HOMEMADE LATHE</B>

<P>
Next we need some homemade lathe brackets and a front and rear spindle
mounts to turn our Foamular project on. The size of your spindles and
brackets will be determined by the size of your project. Nothing fancy is
needed. I used some 3/4" plywood to make the spindle support brackets and
the spindles.  I fastened two ¼ inch x 4 inch bolts to the center of the
spindles to act as the turning axles.  I next centered and attached a BT-60
coupler tube (paper towel tube) to the rear spindle to help center the
engine mount on the spindle.  Next I glue the spindles to the core and let
glue dry completely before mounting spindles and core on the lathe
brackets.  I blocked and shimmed a half inch drill in alignment with the
rear spindle bolt to power the homemade lathe.

<P><B>TURNING THE CORE</B>

<P>
The best speed to turn the foam core for carving is between 150-350 RPM.
Turning any faster and the core will begin to wobble out of round and
eventually break off. It is best to first round the core completely for
balance with a wood rasp. No pressure with the wood rasp is needed, just a
gentle touch as the foam carves quickly. For deeper cuts the foam can be
rough cut to shape with a hobby backsaw and then shaped more with the wood
rasp.

</TR>
</TABLE>

<P>
After the rough shape is attained begin sanding with 50-80-grit sandpaper
to smooth out the surface. Use a respirator to protect yourself from the
fine dust that is created during any sanding. The sanding process can be
graduated to 150, then 220, then 320, and then 400 to attain a smooth
surface. Also sanding sponges, small files, and emery boards can be used
for shaping and finer detailing. It is best to wait to carve any nose cone
and boat tail sections until last, as carving near the spindle mounts may
weaken the mounts.

<P>
<IMG WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=400 SRC="/images/foamturning_transition.jpg">

<P>
Use a hobby backsaw to remove the carved rocket from its mounts and finish
the front and rear by with a little hand sanding. Also pits and scratches
can be filled with lightweight and easily sandable hobby filler while the
rocket is still in its mount.  It is also wise to plan on putting a
protective finish on the rocket while it is still on the mounts to avoid
any accidental damage during handling.  Once your rocket is removed from
its mounts it can be easily damaged without this coating.

<IMG WIDTH=600 HEIGHT=300 SRC="/images/foamturning_nosecone.jpg">

<P><B>EJECTION BAFFLE AND SHOCK CORD MOUNTS</B>

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>
<TR VALIGN=top>
<TD>
I decided to go with an ejection baffle system with an eyebolt shock cord
mount because of the size to this rocket. This section is about 6" long and
will also be used for the coupler tube, ejection baffle, and shock cord
mount on the motor section. Using the Bt-60 coupler tube I tape dammed one
end and centered the eye bolt in it. I next poured epoxy into the coupler
tube at least 1/4" thick to cover the eyebolt nut. When the epoxy is dry
drill several 1/4" holes for the ejection charge to provide separation.

<P>
A second eye bolt attachment will be needed for the recovery section. This
section was made from a 1" piece of coupler tube and tape dammed with the
eyescrew hole to the INSIDE of the coupler tube. Pour epoxy in the same way
as above being sure to surround the nut with epoxy and let dry. I next tied
a 3/8" braided elastic shock cord to this eyebolt and glued it in the
forward end of the recovery section using a long couple tube to push it
into the pre-glued section.

<P><B>FIN ATTACHMENT AND MOTOR MOUNT</B>

<P>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLSPACING=0 CELLPADDING=0>
<TR VALIGN=top>
<TD>
I decided to go with a 24mm motor mount tube which I had on hand and custom
made my own centering rings from 1/4" balsa plywood. I next used a hobby
backsaw to notch out fin slots in the foam down to the BT-60 tube and glued
them in with foamboard adhesive.

<P><B>PROTECTIVE COATING</B>

<IMG WIDTH=80 HEIGHT=310 SRC="/images/foamturning_rocketdone.jpg" ALIGN=right>
<P>
I decided that my rocket needed a protective epoxy coating so I decided to
use Devcon 60 minute epoxy and skip any fiberglass cloth to save
weight. The epoxy coating without the fiberglass cloth proved to be
unsatisfactory for strength. I have recently discovered 3/4-oz. fiberglass
cloth, slikspan cloth, tag board, vaccum bagging, carbon fiber matte, and
intent to cover the rocket when time and finances allow.

<P><B>ROCKET NAMED: "IT"</B>

<P>
I have decided to name this rocket the "IT". The finished is 47 inches
long and 3 3/4 inches in diameter at IT'S widest point. The IT has been
swing tested and nose weight has been added to make it flight stable. An
test flight was attempted, however while I was hooking up the wire leads a
at a local park I was told by the park caretaker that rockets were not
allowed in Mason County Parks so I had to leave.
