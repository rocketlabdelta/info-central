This is an extract from the
<A HREF="http://www.atf.treas.gov" TARGET=_blank>ATF web site</A>
on requirements for "type 4" magazines.
Type 4 indoor magazines are commonly used by rocketeers for storing high-power motors.
</P>

<P>
<B>Sec. 55.210  Construction of type 4 magazines.</B>

<P>
A type 4 magazine is a building, igloo or "Army-type structure",
tunnel, dugout, box, trailer, or a semitrailer or other mobile magazine.

<P>
(a) Outdoor magazines--

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(1) General. Outdoor magazines are to be
fire-resistant, weather-resistant, and theft-resistant. The ground
around outdoor magazines must slope away for drainage or other adequate
drainage be provided. When unattended, vehicular magazines must have
wheels removed or otherwise be effectively immobilized by kingpin
locking devices or other methods approved by the Director.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(2) Construction. Outdoor magazines are to be constructed of
masonry, metal-covered wood, fabricated metal, or a combination of these
materials. Foundations are to be constructed of brick, concrete, cement
block, stone, or metal or wood posts. If piers or posts are used, in
lieu of a continuous foundation, the space under the building is to be
enclosed with fire-resistant material. The walls and floors are to be
constructed of, or covered with, a nonsparking material or lattice work.
The doors must be metal or solid wood covered with metal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(3) Hinges and hasps. Hinges and hasps are to be attached to doors
by welding, riveting, or bolting (nuts on inside of door). Hinges and
hasps must be installed so that they cannot be removed when the doors
are closed and locked.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(4) Locks. Each door is to be equipped with (i) two mortise locks;
<BR>(ii) two padlocks fastened in separate hasps and staples;
<BR>(iii) a combination of a mortise lock and a padlock;
<BR>(iv) a mortise lock that requires two keys to open; or
<BR>(v) a three-point lock.
<BR>Padlocks must have
at least five tumblers and case-hardened shackle of at least 3/8 inch
diameter. Padlocks must be protected with[[Page 752]]
not less than 1/4 inch steel hoods constructed so as to prevent sawing
or lever action on the locks, hasps, and staples. These requirements do
not apply to magazine doors that are adequately secured on the inside by
means of a bolt, lock, or bar that cannot be actuated from the outside.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
(b) Indoor magazine--

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(1) General. Indoor magazines are to be fire-
resistant and theft-resistant. They need not be weather-resistant if the
buildings in which they are stored provide protection from the weather.
No indoor magazine is to be located in a residence or dwelling. The
indoor storage of low explosives must not exceed a quantity of 50
pounds. More than one indoor magazine may be located in the same
building if the total quantity of explosive materials stored does not
exceed 50 pounds. Detonators that will not mass detonate must be stored
in a separate magazine and the total number of electric detonators must
not exceed 5,000.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(2) Construction. Indoor magazines are to be constructed of masonry,
metal-covered wood, fabricated metal, or a combination of these
materials. The walls and floors are to be constructed of, or covered
with, a nonsparking material. The doors must be metal or solid wood
covered with metal.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(3) Hinges and hasps. Hinges and hasps are to be attached to doors
by welding, riveting, or bolting (nuts on inside of door). Hinges and
hasps must be installed so that they cannot be removed when the doors
are closed and locked.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
(4) Locks. Each door is to be equipped with (i) two mortise locks;
<BR>(ii) two padlocks fastened in separate hasps and staples;
<BR>(iii) a
combination of a mortise lock and padlock;
<BR>(iv) a mortise lock that
requires two keys to open; or
<BR>(v) a three-point lock.
<BR>Padlocks must have at least five tumblers and a case-hardened
shackle of at least 3/8 inch diameter.
Padlocks must be protected with not less than 1/4 inch
steel hoods constructed so as to prevent sawing or lever action on the
locks, hasps, and staples. Indoor magazines located in secure rooms that
are locked as provided in this subparagraph may have each door locked
with one steel padlock (which need not be protected by a steel hood)
having at least five tumblers and a case-hardened shackle of at least
3/8 inch diameter, if the door hinges and lock hasp are securely
fastened to the magazine. These requirements do not apply to magazine
doors that are adequately secured on the inside by means of a bolt,
lock, or bar that cannot be actuated from the outside.
