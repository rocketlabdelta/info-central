Fin flutter is the phenomenon of a fin oscillating while in flight. In mild
cases you can hear the telltale buzz or hum of the fins after the rocket is
launched. In more severe cases the fins will oscillate to the point that
the fin material fails and they are actually ripped off of the rocket
causing a spectacular shred. Why do some rockets exhibit fin flutter and
most don't? How can you predict whether a particular design will cause
flutter? What does cause flutter? I decided to try and find out the answers
to some of these questions recently and in my research came across a
remarkable paper published by NACA in 1958 that not only examines the
various types of flutter but also contains a simple algorithm for
determining flutter susceptibility and determining the likely velocity at
which flutter will occur. NACA performed over 100 different wind tunnel
tests confirming this algorithm for various missile designs at low
supersonic and subsonic airspeeds so it seems like a great place for the
amateur community to start in an attempt to understand the flutter we
experience. Obviously it will need to be verified for the materials,
designs, and velocities that we use today.

<P>
<IMG WIDTH=358 HEIGHT=264 SRC="/images/finflutter_types.gif" ALT="examples of fin flutter modes">

<P>
There are at least three different types of flutter that have been
examined by NACA (the precursor to NASA) rocket and missile designers: fin
(wing) bending-torsion flutter, stall flutter, and pitch-bending
flutter. Stall flutter occurs at high angle of attacks when the fin is near
stall. Since high angles of attack and fin stall usually only occur at low
velocity (near apogee) with amateur rockets it is not likely that we will
experience this type of flutter. Pitch-bending flutter is reported to be
less common and involves the natural frequency of oscillation of the rocket
body interacting with bending of the fins. It can occur at lower speeds
than bending-torsion flutter and is most likely to occur in high moment of
inertia rockets with rectangular wings where the ratio of
CG-to-fin-leading-edge distance to fin chord is high. I am not addressing
pitch-bending flutter here, but it seems like an interesting area to
investigate further. The most likely cause of fin flutter is
bending-torsion flutter and is the subject here. Bending-torsion flutter
occurs when two natural modes of fin oscillation interact through mutual
resonance- fin bending and fin panel torsion or twisting. Figure 1 shows
examples of the three types of fin flutter.

<P>
All mechanical structures have what is called a natural frequency of
oscillation. The natural frequency of oscillation is distinct from
vibration modes and most structures will never oscillate or even vibrate at
exactly the natural frequency. Natural frequency of oscillation is one of
those physical properties that you may never interact with directly but it
has a great effect on the behavior of the structure. In the case of rocket
fins there are actually two different natural frequencies: one associated
with bending and one associated with torsion or twisting. Systems with two
different types of natural frequencies may also be described as having two
degrees of freedom. It is interesting that two degrees of freedom are
necessary to describe fin flutter whereas the entire rocket can have its
stability analyzed using just one degree of freedom (usually angle of
attack). I originally thought that fin flutter would be caused by a simple
resonance that made the fin flex up and down (the "bending" part of
bending-torsion) but it turns out that if a fin can bend but not twist
(i.e. has only one degree of freedom), or vice-versa, the air moving past
the fin will damp out any oscillations. What is happening is that air
moving over the not-perfectly-smooth fin puts energy into the fin. If the
fin can't move, the energy becomes heat. If the fin can move it first
causes the fin to bend, which stores the energy in the same way a stretched
spring does. The stiffness of the fin makes the fin try and bend back. When
it bends back the energy that was stored in the deflected fin now causes
the fin to twist, storing the energy in the twisted fin. The pattern is now
set and the bend-twist-bend-twist cycle of oscillation will continue as
long as sufficient energy is being added to the system. There will be
internal frictional losses in the fin that will dissipate some of the
energy, but the energy contained in the moving air increases as the square
of the velocity. If the rocket is accelerating during the onset of flutter
then with that much energy going into the fin the oscillations will
increase dramatically until the fin (possibly) fails.

<P>
Bending-torsion flutter would be modeled by a physicist as a resonant
coupled harmonic oscillator with two degrees of freedom. A well known
example of this type of oscillator is the Wilberforce pendulum pictured
below. It is also interesting to note that resonant coupled harmonic
oscillators with two degrees of freedom can, under the right conditions,
exhibit chaotic motion. Maybe that explains some of those weird flutters
you've experienced!

To solve the flutter equations analytically is possible but it is
pretty difficult. Today aerodynamicists probably use computational fluid
dynamics or finite element analysis software to analyze these sorts of
problems. But back in the 1950's engineers would go to great lengths to
find graphical techniques or other ways to simplify problems and get
practical solutions. In 1940 NACA published a paper (reference 1) where the
authors mentioned that some of the flutter curves they had graphed could be
approximated by a simple closed-form expression or formula. In 1958, Dennis
Martin, also of NACA, seized on this discovery and extended it for use with
missiles (reference 2). He checked the formula against the flutter behavior
of over 100 different characterized missile configurations and found a
remarkable degree of correlation. Martin graphed the product of three
factors: a factor he called X (defined below), the taper ratio <I>l</I>, and the
ratio of atmospheric pressure to standard atmospheric pressure <I>p/p0.</I>
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=111 HEIGHT=70 SRC="/images/finflutter_eqn1.gif">

<P>
Where 
<BR>A is the aspect ratio
<BR>t is the fin thickness
<BR>c is the fin root chord

<P>
Let's call Martin's three factor product the flutter index:
<BR>
<IMG WIDTH=153 HEIGHT=51 SRC="/images/finflutter_eqn2.gif">

<P>
Where 
<BR>l is the taper ratio (ratio of tip chord to root chord)
<BR>p is the air pressure
<BR>p0 is the air pressure at sea level

<P>
The flutter index is a relative index of flutter susceptibility for a given
fin material which should be checked against a data set of fin designs
(including fin geometry and material) and known flutter behavior. Martin
did just that with his 100 data points and the plot is shown below in
Figure 3.

<P>
What does all of this mean? Well the first thing to notice is that
flutter susceptibility is linear with the flutter index and the smaller the
flutter index the better, so if the FI doubles you are twice as well
off. Doubling the fin material shear modulus also makes you twice as well
off (shear modulus is described in the next section). The second thing to
notice is that the thickness ratio t/c decreases the flutter index and is
cubed. That means that doubling the thickness ratio makes you eight times
better off. Doubling the fin root chord without changing the fin thickness
makes you eight times worse off. The aspect ratio A is a bit of a mixed bag
because it has a cubed term but is also divided by itself. It turns out
that for the range of aspect ratios that we are concerned with (about 1.4
to 0.75), the aspect ratio will have basically a linear effect so halving
the fin aspect ratio makes you only twice as well off. To finish off the
discussion of the FI variables we need to consider the pressure ratio and
the taper ratio. The taper ratio is a factor of one half of the change, so
it has little effect. The pressure ratio p/p0 can have some moderate effect
since the pressure ratio goes from 1.00 at sea level to 0.37 at 25,000 feet
ASL (don't forget to factor in launch elevation). Since the pressure ratio
goes down it does tend to help things out.

Figure 3 plots the flutter index against the other important factor that we
need to consider, which is shear modulus. Shear modulus is a measure of the
fin materials ability to resist bending and twisting, in other words it is
a measure of stiffness. There are two ways to use this graph, either decide
which fin material you are going to use and then determine the appropriate
flutter index that you will need, or determine which material you should
fabricate your fins from given the flutter index of their geometry. Martin
checked each missile configuration over a range of at least 1.3
Mach. Figure 3 is not a normal plot of a dependent variable against an
independent variable. Instead it is what is called a scatter plot and shows
the statistical relationship of the two variables in terms of flutter
susceptibility. Using Figure 3, if you draw a vertical line from the x-axis
starting at the shear modulus of your fin material and a horizontal line
from the y-axis starting at the flutter index number for your fin design,
the intersection of those two lines is the flutter susceptibility of your
rocket. If it ends up above the shaded line on the graph (in the region
containing all of the black dots) your rocket will probably experience fin
flutter. If the intersection lands below the shaded line your rocket is
OK. For designs that end up above the shaded line you can either change
your fin material (effectively moving the vertical line you drew to the
right), or change your design to lower the flutter index (effectively
moving the horizontal line you drew down). Of course you should also factor
in some kind of safety margin.

<P>
One other formula that we can use is the formula for flutter
velocity. It is not clear to me exactly what the flutter velocity actually
is (onset of flutter, a figure of merit like the flutter index, or hard
flutter) but the safe thing to assume is that if your rocket is near the
flutter velocity you are in trouble. In any case the flutter velocity is

<P>
Where 
<BR>V<SUB>a</SUB> is the speed of sound 
<BR>G<SUB>E</SUB> is the shear modulus

<P>
I have made up an
<A HREF="finflutter.xls">Excel spreadsheet</A>
that captures these equations and
calculates both the flutter velocity and the flutter index. The air
pressure is assumed to be sea level so that p/p0 is equal to one. I
included a variety of fin styles and materials. It is interesting to note
that the flutter indexes that I calculated range from about 1x106 to
16.5x106, which is in the upper 25% of all of the FI's that Martin
examined. Similarly the shear moduli range from 4x106 to 10x106
(disregarding balsa and plywood where I don't trust the numbers), which
is in the upper 20% of all the materials that Martin plotted. For the
materials the interpretation is simple: we have very stiff materials
available to us today, perhaps stiffer than 1958. 6061-T6 aluminum has the
same rating as Martin's steel does for instance. S-glass is almost as stiff
as his titanium. On the other hand, the FI numbers say that our fins
probably have a lower thickness ratio than in the good old days, which may
not be a good thing.

<P>
Where do we go from here? All of the material presented here doesn't mean
much if it can't be confirmed under actual amateur rocketry flying
conditions. Maybe we don't experience bending-torsion flutter after
all. The shear modulus numbers need to be checked, more materials (such as
carbon fiber) added, and a data set similar to Figure 3 developed that
reflects actual results with actual rockets. My dream scenario would be to
check out the flutter mechanism in a wind tunnel (anyone have
access?). Until then, use the flutter spreadsheet when designing your next
scratch built and report your experience on ROL. I'd appreciate your
feedback as well (<A HREF="mailto:duncan@transim.com">duncan@transim.com</A>).
