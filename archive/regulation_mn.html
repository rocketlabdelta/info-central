<P>
The Minnesota State Fire Marshall's Office's position on the regulation
of model and high power rocketry is that, in the absence of specific
local codes or standards (see below), both model rocketry and high power
rocketry should be carried out in conformance with NFPA 1122 and NFPA
1127, respectively, in addition to any applicable Federal regulations.
</P>

<P>
In the Fire Marshall's opinion, The Explosive Materials rules (Article
77 of the Minnesota Fire Code, which incorporates the Uniform Fire Code
(UFC)) do not come into play unless activities fall outside those NFPA
standards (e.g., using non certified motors).  The citation for their
reliance on NFPA is Minnesota Fire Code Article 1, Section 101.3, "Subjects
Not Specifically Regulated by this Code," which states that compliance with
any adopted NFPA code is acceptable.
</P>

<P>
Of course, when the BATF rules are <I>more</I> restrictive than NFPA 1127,
the BATF rules need to be followed--but that's not an enforcement issue at
the state level. There are no use or storage permits required at the
state level: The permit clauses that exist in the UFC were deleted in
the Minnesota fire code, as was the insurance requirement. The MN SFM phone
is (651) 215-0500. The person to talk to is Kevin Kelly.
</P>

<P>
There are local jurisdictions that have their own requirements.  The
current position of the City of Minneapolis is that if a BATF permit is
required for storage, then a low explosive permit ($25) and an inspection is
required by the Minneapolis Fire Department.  The Minneapolis Fire
Department Inspector to talk to is Denise Byrn at (612) 673-3273.
</P>

<P> The Minneapolis Park Board appears to technically prohibit launches in
city parks [Ordinance PB2-30], but regularly violates this with their own
summer camp activities, and I've seen (and in some cases supervised) a lot
of school group launches which proceed without incident, some with Park
Police officers as spectators.  The UFC is available at county
libraries--make sure you look at the latest(1997) version.
</P>

<P>
NFPA 1122 and 1127 are available from NARTS, at the same ungodly price
as they are from the NFPA itself. They are copyrighted and not on the web,
but TRA has adopted most of 1127 as its safety code.
</P>

<P>
Minneapolis ordinances are on the web; start at
