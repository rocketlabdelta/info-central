<P><B>BACKGROUND</B>

<P>
Let me begin by saying I am no expert when it comes to model rocketry. It
is one of those things I did as a kid and have only recently discovered
there is way more to rocketry than just the old Estes A through D size
rockets and motors, which was basically all we had here in Australia when I
was growing up.

<P>
After discovering all these wonderful new types of rockets I purchased an
Aerotech Mustang to get me back into model rocketry. After having a ball
with this rocket and seeing what other people had done with aerial
photography, I wondered if it was possible to put a camera in a rocket body
only 47mm in diameter. Sure I thought and so I purchased the Aerotech
Arreaux, which has a reasonable sized payload bay for such a small rocket
(by High Powered rocket standards). What follows is how I managed to
squeeze a radio controlled digital camera into it.

<P>
Please note that this system was a real trial and error job. There are
probably plenty of better ways to assemble some of the parts, use certain
glues, cutting methods, etc. The method I'm describing is the way I did
it. And one last thing worth mentioning, due to the fact that we live in a
crazy world dominated by litigation, I felt I had to include a disclaimer
at the end of this document, just in case something untoward happens. That
said, let's get busy.


<P><B>A SLIGHT MODIFICATION TO YOUR ROCKET</B>

<P>
Before getting started, I suggest you make sure your payload bay has a nice
clean bottom to it. In the Arreaux rocket the upper "Screw Eye" that the
shock cord attaches to, sticks into the payload bay. To avoid damage to
anything you put in there (especially from a sharp pointed screw), I cut a
piece of 2mm ply the exact diameter of the payload tube and slid it in and
glued it in place. If you decide to do this, do it first so that you have
an accurate size to work to with respect to the length of your payload bay.


<P><B>THE CAMERA</B>

<P>
The first thing I had to do was find a camera not only small enough to fit
inside, but one that could be mounted effectively in some sort of cradle,
one that would take minimum intervention from me to actually take a shot
and a camera that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg. After looking at a number
mechanical cameras of various sizes, I stumbled across a fantastic little
camera from Dolphin Peripherals in California called the "Dolphin Pocket
Digital Camera". This little marvel is so small yet does so much.

<P>
I've included the
<A HREF="dolphincam_instr.pdf">PDF instruction manual</A>
from Dolphin that will explain
everything you need to know about the camera. But just briefly here are its
specifications:

<UL>
<LI>Sensor Type: Color CIF (352 x 288) CMOS image sensor
<LI>Image Performance for Video Stream:
<BR>- 9 fps for CIF (352 x 288)
<BR>- 20 fps for QCIF (176 x 144)
<LI>Memory & Images: SDRAM 16Mbit (1M x 16): 20 Pictures for CIF, 80 Pictures for QCIF
<LI>Dimension: 125mm x 30mm x 25mm
<LI>Battery: Two AAA 1.5 volt alkaline batteries
<LI>Battery Capacity:
<BR>- Continuous: 2 hours
<BR>- Stand by: approximately 2 weeks
<LI>Lens View Angle: 54 Degrees
<LI>Focus Mode: Fixed
<LI>Focus Length: 5.2mm
<LI>Exposure Control: Automatic
<LI>Auto Shut Off: 30 seconds
<LI>Self Timer Duration: 10 seconds
<LI>Software Support : Microsoft Windows 98(tm),
<BR>Microsoft Windows 2000(tm),
<BR>Microsoft Windows ME(tm),
<BR>Interface Type: USB 
</UL>

<P>
The other great thing about this camera is if you hold the button down, it
automatically takes its maximum of 80 shots which you can reassemble into a
video on your computer with the software supplied with the camera.

<P>
Of course the thing that appeals most to the 47mm rocketeer, is the
physical size of the unit, which means it fits very easily into the payload
tube of an Aerotech Arreaux rocket. The other great thing is that it only
cost me around A$140 which works out to about US$70. Plus being digital,
there's no film to worry about and I just have to connect up my laptop to
the camera via the USB cable after a flight and I can see the shots it took
out in the field. Please be aware that you are buying a cheap digital
camera so the picture quality isn't what you get with a $1000 digital
camera, but then what do you expect for such a low price - but they're
pretty good. The .pdf instruction guide has a few samples in it and here
are two of my own, taken with my camera. The first was taken standing
still, the second from a moving vehicle.

<P><B>THE RADIO CONTROL UNIT</B>

<P>
The radio control unit I am using for the ArreauxCam is a pretty basic
one. It's a "Hi-Tech" brand FM unit that operates on a frequency of
36.370MHz. As I already had a radio control unit fitted to a model glider,
it was simply a case of unplugging the receiver, on/off switch and battery
pack from the glider and I was set. However, the next thing to figure out
was what to do about a servo. I needed something from Hi-Tec that would
work with my existing unit, but was also very small and lightweight. Off to
the hobby shop where I came across an incredibly small but powerful
sub-micro servo known as the HiTec HS-55. Here are its specifications:

</TABLE>

<P>
This gutsy little servo has enough power in it to press the button on the
Dolphin camera, with no problems at all.


<P><B>CRADLE CONSTRUCTION</B>

<P>
There were two things I had to work out up front. How to hold the camera in
the rocket and how to trigger it to take a shot. What I came up with is a
type of 'cradle' that slides inside the payload bay and holds everything
needed to take a photo.

<P>
The basic design of the cradle is similar to that of a model aircraft
frame, so for ease of explanation, I'll use a few model aircraft terms to
describe the main parts of it.

<P>
The most important terms are 'stringers' and 'formers' and in case you're
not familiar with the terms, I'll briefly explain them.

<P>
A stringer is a strip of timber placed lengthwise to form the 'ribs' of a
frame, ie they run from one end of a fuselage to the other in a model
aircraft. Formers are the flat sections that hold the stringers up and in
place. I guess they're like bulkheads set various distances apart along the
fuselage.

<P>
For this cradle, I cut 4 stringers and 4 formers. Although you'll see that
there is a fifth former that a buzzer sits on, right on the very top of the
cradle. If you're not putting the buzzer in, you'll only have to cut 4. 

<P><IMG WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=325 SRC="/images/dolphincam_complete.jpg">

<P>
Here's the complete camera unit with the stringers running from left to
right and the ply formers running up and down holding them in place.


<P>
The formers are cut from 2mm thick plywood, that you'll get from a local
hobby shop and their diameters are as follows:

<BR>3 x 44.5mm
<BR>1 x 43.5mm
<BR>1 x 40.5mm (Optional 5th former)

<P>
To make things easy to follow, let's number them from bottom to top and in
this order:

<BR>#1 - 44.5mm
<BR>#2 - 44.5mm
<BR>#3 - 44.5mm
<BR>#4 - 43.5mm
<BR>#5 - 40.5mm

<P>
The stringers are cut from 5mm x 5mm timber which in my case was pine, but
just about any variety of model aircraft grade timber will do. The four
stringers are 225mm long.

<P>
Once you have these cut, you need to put the cradle together. Take formers
1,2,3 and 4 and mark on them four notches, 5mm x 5mm at a 30º spacing left
and right of the centre line, top and bottom. I know this sounds strange
but if you look at the picture below you'll see what I mean.

<P><IMG WIDTH=189 HEIGHT=228 SRC="/images/dolphincam_template.gif">

<P>
This is how your formers should look when cut.

<P>
Once you've marked and cut out the notches, test fit your stringers to
ensure they fit firmly. Once that's done, glue your stringers into the
formers at the points shown on the dimensions photograph below. Note that
the measurements are taken from the centre of one former to the next, NOT
the inside measurement.

<P><IMG WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=325 SRC="/images/dolphincam_dimensions.jpg">

<P>
The completed unit with the measurements between each former.

<P>
I used an epoxy glue for strength but I guess a Cyanoacrylate Super Glue
such as "Flash" would work. The only reason I use epoxy is that I can trust
its strength and I loathe using Cyanoacrylate glues as I can never get them
to stick. Anyway, that's up to you.

<P>
The space between formers 1 and 2 is obviously just big enough to get the
receiver in. The space between formers 2 and 3 is just big enough for the
servo. And the space between 3 and 4, is just big enough for the
camera. The space between 4 and 5 is just big enough for the 'throw' of the
rod that runs between the servo and the push-button on the camera. Try to
keep the tolerances as tight as you can.


<P><B>INSTALLING THE HARDWARE</B>

<P>
Putting the receiver, servo and camera in is a little fiddly, but the
closer the fit the more you'll lessen the chance of movement from the
G-forces of flight on the payload.

<P><B>CAMERA INSTALLATION</B>

<P>
Probably the first thing to fit is the camera. To get it to 'clip' into the
cradle, I began by taking the plastic desktop holder that you get with the
camera and cutting it down so that it was only 7mm high. As the inside
bottom of the holder has plastic reinforcing tabs, cut these out so that
you have a nice smooth inside base. Next, mix up some epoxy putty and push
it into the cut-down base. Then place a piece of plastic food wrap over the
base of your camera (to protect it) and push it into the epoxy and make
sure it's square and vertical. This will make a nice firm fitting base for
your camera to sit in. If you look at the picture below, you'll see the
base.

<P><IMG WIDTH=432 HEIGHT=539 SRC="/images/dolphincam_base.jpg">

<P>
Wait for the epoxy to dry, trim it off flush, sand it, etc. so that it
looks neat.

<P>
The next thing is to get the camera in just the right spot. Doing this
takes a bit of fiddling around but it's not difficult. Here's how.

<P>
You get with the camera, a plastic pocket clip, which clips onto the back
of the camera. Clip it on and slide the camera into the top of the
cradle. Place your bottom holder under it, as this will lift it up a
little. Slide the camera to one side of the cradle (call it the back if you
like), and see where the pocket clip sits in relation to the
stringers. Mark the point where the underside of the pocket clip is lined
up with your two back stringers. This will be where your supporting rod
goes through, and supports the top of the camera. I used a piece of 3mm
steel rod (again from the hobby shop), as it is the right size for the
pocket clip to clip onto and not move. Next, cut the pocket clip down so
that you only have to lift the camera 2-3mm to unhook it off the
rod. Whatever the amount is that you have to lift it, you must allow this
much clearance between the top of the camera and former 4, so that you'll
be able to get the camera out to change batteries, etc.

<P>
Drill your holes through the formers and slide your piece of rod through,
glue and cut to fit. Test fit the camera again with its base on.

<P>
The next thing to do is attach the camera base to the upper side of former
3. To do this (A 5 minute epoxy is best for this one), spread some glue
roughly where the base will sit, slide the camera in and press the base
with the camera sitting in it, into the epoxy, then let dry. As you can see
in the previous photo, I also included a cut-down screw through the centre
of it, just to be sure. Below is a photo of the camera in place.
 
<P><IMG WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=596 SRC="/images/dolphincam_camerainplace.jpg">

<P>
You can see the completed base and rod that the pocket clip actually clips
onto to secure the top of the camera.

<P><IMG WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=362 SRC="/images/dolphincam_cameraout.jpg">

<P>
Here's the camera out of the cradle. You can see the rod that it clips onto
3/4 of the way up the cradle, running between 2 stringers.


<P><B>SERVO INSTALLATION</B>

<P>
Now that your camera is in, you can put the servo in. This is quite easy
and is just a matter of gluing two 5mm x 5mm timber strips within the
cradle and then screwing the servo onto them. One strip goes on the upper
side of former 2, the other on the lower side of former 3, up against the
two back stringers. Positioning of the servo is takes a bit of adjustment,
but basically as long as the control linkage from the servo to the camera
button clears the stringers and the camera, that's all that matters. Also
don't forget to drill a hole through former 2, to run your servo cable
through to the receiver.

<P><IMG WIDTH=497 HEIGHT=619 SRC="/images/dolphincam_servo.jpg">

<P>
Sorry about the blur, but you can see the servo screwed into position.


<P><B>RECEIVER INSTALLATION</B>

<P>
Next you have to fit the receiver. It slides in between formers 1 and 2 and
kind of locks itself into the space with all the wires, plugs and switch
around it to stop it from moving. You'll also need to drill a hole in
former 1 to run the + & - wires from the batteries to the receiver.

<P>
You'll also need to drill holes through formers 2,3,4 and 5 to run the
antenna wire through. Make sure you attach the antenna wire to the inside
of one of the stringers, so that it can't wave about during flight.

<P><IMG WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=312 SRC="/images/dolphincam_receiver.jpg">

<P>
Here's the receiver in place. As you can see the on/off switch for the
receiver and servo hold it in place.


<P><B>BATTERY INSTALLATION</B>

<P>
You've probably noticed that the battery pack is on the bottom of the
cradle and that the batteries aren't your typical AA size normally
associated with R/C receivers but AAA batteries. The reason for putting
there is that I didn't want to overload the top of the rocket, it was
starting to get "top-heavy". Also, the reason for changing to AAA batteries
was primarily for weight reduction. I figured that as a flight is so short
and the number of shots being taken quite few, the drain by the receiver on
the batteries would be minimal. Whatever size you go with, glue the battery
holder onto the base of former 1, and thread the wires up through former 1
ready to be connected into the receiver.

<P><IMG WIDTH=427 HEIGHT=575 SRC="/images/dolphincam_battery.jpg">

<P>
The battery holder glued onto the bottom of former 1.


<P><B>SERVO CONNECTION TO CAMERA BUTTON</B>

<P>
This is probably the most difficult part of the whole project - but not too
difficult. The first thing to do is take off the battery cover on the
camera. Then undo the two screws holding on the back of the camera. Then
carefully pry the two halves open. (Yes I know, it's a brand new digital
camera and I'm telling you to pull it apart. I was nervous at first but
once I'd done it once... no problems). The two halves are held together
with tabs that will pop apart. The only hard one is the one at the top
which takes a little more effort but will pop open.

<P>
Being careful not to touch anything inside, remove the plastic push button
at the top of the camera - it just comes out, you'll see it when you open
the camera. Then put the camera back together again - snap back the two
halves, put in the screws, battery cover - done. The actual switch that is
depressed when you take a photo, is soldered onto the PC board inside the
camera, so the push button you are taking out is just a piece of plastic
that allows you to push the button down.

<P>
Using the plastic button as a guide, make up a lump of epoxy putty bigger
than the original button, particularly in length. Once this has dried, you
need to carve a new button exactly the same width/diameter as the real one
but 13mm in length. Constantly check it's size against the hole in the
camera's body. When it slides up and down freely but not loosely, it's
ready.

<P>
You now need to make the rod that links the servo and the button. I used a
piece of 1mm wire and bent it to form a right angle on one end to go
through the hole in the servo's plastic arm. A small blob of solder was put
on the end of this so it wouldn't slip out.

<P>
Next work out just where the hole for your new camera button has to go
through former 4. This takes a bit of time to get right but it's not
difficult - just a few measurements to get the hole in the right place. If
you make your hole a little bigger than the button, it gives you room for
adjustment , but don't make it too loose.

<P>
Next you'll need to drill two holes through formers 3 and 4 for the servo
rod to the button. Again it's just a bit of measuring to get them in the
right spot and as with the button hole, make them a little larger than the
rod to allow for adjustment.

<P>
Once your holes are cut, drop the button in to the camera so that it sticks
up through the top of former 4. Thread the servo arm onto the rod and slide
it down to the bottom. Slide the rod up through formers 3 and 4 and attach
the servo arm on to the servo.

<P>
By pressing your new button down you'll see that the servo only has to move
the button by around 1-2mm when it's sitting on top of the switch inside
the camera. So mark on the rod sticking up through former 4, where a right
angle bend has to go, then another bend so that the rod will stick into the
centre of the new button. The picture below will give you some idea as to
what the rod looks like.

<P><IMG WIDTH=527 HEIGHT=72 SRC="/images/dolphincam_bentrod.gif">

<P>
A fairly crude drawing of the connecting rod shows it's rough shape. The
rectangular box near the top is the button the rod gets glued into.

<P>
Drill a hole in the top of your epoxy button, push in the rod and glue it
in place.

<P>
NOTE: You need to make sure that when your servo is at it's upper most
point before hitting the underside of former 3, that your new button is in
the up position out of the camera body and almost flush with the underside
of former 4. This allows you to lift the camera up enough to clear the
sides of it's base as well as unhook itself from the upper pocket clip
rod. The photo and text below will help explain what I mean.

<P><IMG WIDTH=520 HEIGHT=551 SRC="/images/dolphincam_button.jpg">

<P>
This is the home-made button in place, just sticking out from the top of
the camera body. When the servo lifts the rod up, it lifts the button clear
of the camera body so that you can get the camera out.


<P><B>WIRING</B>

<P>
The way you do your wiring is up to you. But I suggest you do it once
everything is screwed or mounted in place, so that you get the best fit
with your wires and don't have pieces of wire hanging everywhere.


<P><B>OPTIONAL LOCATOR</B>

<P>
You may have noticed a small circuit board mounted on the side of the
receiver. This is simply to help me find the rocket once it has landed. It
basically starts beeping the moment I turn off my transmitter. I'm not sure
where I originally got my beeper plans from but you'll find a couple of
different ones on a great website operated by Tony Van Roon. To give you a
better idea as to how the beeper works, here's Tony's explanation:

<P>
"A transmitter provides every 20 milliseconds a set of pulses, which in
turn sends your receiver a separate pulse to each of the servos at the same
interval. The plans for this circuit allow you to build a so-called
"missing-pulse-detector." An alarm will sound when your receiver no longer
receives the set of pulses from your radio. So, to locate your aircraft,
all you have to do is switch your transmitter off and the locator will
start to beep."

<P>
Tony's website can be found at:
<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/gadgets/gadgets.htm">www.uoguelph.ca/~antoon/gadgets/gadgets.htm</A>.

<P>
It's up to you where you mount the piezo alarm, but as you can see, I put
it on top of the entire cradle on the optional 5th former. When you mount
this, be careful to give it enough clearance from the servo/button rod when
it moves into its upward position. If it's not far enough away, the rod
will hit the underside of former 5 and as a result, you may not be able to
get the button up high enough thereby preventing you from getting your
camera out.

<P><IMG WIDTH=480 HEIGHT=559 SRC="/images/dolphincam_buzzer.jpg">

<P>
The Piezo buzzer mounted on the top of former 5.


<P><B>ROCKET MODIFICATIONS</B>

<P>
The next thing to do is modify your Arreaux to accept the ArreauxCam. This
is easy. First slide the cradle with the camera on-board into the payload
bay of your Arreaux. You'll notice it sticks out the top quite a bit -
don't worry, this is OK. Your lens will be partially obscured by the body
of your rocket. So take a measurement 10mm from the centre of the lens and
mark it on your payload tube. Then take a measurement 10mm out left and
right from the centre and mark these on the tube as well. Cut out the part
of the lens window from your payload tube.

<P>
Before you can slide on your nose cone, you may find that it requires a
little sanding to get it to fit. What I mean by this is that the inside of
the plastic shoulder of your nose cone may need to be thinned a little to
fit between the inside wall of your payload bay tube and former 4. I used a
Dremel with a drum sanding accessory and it was very quick and easy to
do. Just make sure you run the Dremel at a low speed otherwise you could
melt the plastic inside the nose.

<P>
The idea is to make it a snug fit, again, to prevent any movement in
flight. If you have former 5 fitted, don't worry about its size. I've made
it small enough to fit up inside the nose cone.

<P>
Once you've sanded your nose cone and got it fitting snugly, slide the cone
on over the exposed part of the camera and cradle.

<P>
Given that the lens window needs to be around 20mm x 20mm, work out the
difference between what you've already cut out of the payload bay and the
overall size of 20mm and mark it on your nose cone. Cut the hole in your
nose cone and you're done.

<P><IMG WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=376 SRC="/images/dolphincam_payloadnose.jpg">

<P>
Here you can see the small piece cut out of the payload tube and the larger
piece out of the nose cone. The white part of the nose is the thinned out
shoulder section.


<P><B>TESTING</B>

<P>
Before your first flight, ensure you test your camera thoroughly and become
familiar with its features. In fact, before you buy the camera, check that
it does what you want, then go and buy it. As I said before, the pictures
aren't the quality you get with a $1000 digital camera, but then what do
you expect for such a low price.

<P>
Assuming you use the Dolphin Pocket Digital Camera, test the settings on
your servo, like where the arm is positioned, etc, and check the controls
on your transmitter so that you know when a picture has been taken. Try it
out a few times to get used to it. The next step is to put it in your
rocket and try taking shots again. What you're really ensuring here is that
the lens window is big enough for the camera's field of view, however I
have found that 20mm x 20mm is large enough.

<P><IMG WIDTH=537 HEIGHT=371 SRC="/images/dolphincam_insert1.jpg">

<P><B>CONCLUSIONS</B>

<P>
At the time of writing, I haven't flown my ArreauxCam yet. I'm still trying
to get a hold of a larger parachute (don't forget that - recalculate the
size of your chute based on the new mass of your rocket, including
batteries!).

<P>
Once I have the chute, I'll launch the ArreauxCam and see what I get
back. I'll update this document as I go along with any other tips and
suggestions that may come out of the flights.

<P>
Just a word of warning. By adding a camera and associated hardware, you are
seriously changing the flight dynamics of your rocket. Please ensure you
recalculate your CG and CP figures to ensure your rocket is stable before
you go ahead and launch it.

<P>
Have Fun and Clear Skies.
