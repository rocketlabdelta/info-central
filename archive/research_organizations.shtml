Since TRA prefects conduct "research" rocket launch activities, the
organization would be a reasonable place to start, if you are interested in
engineering your own rocket motors
(<A HREF="http://www.tripoli.org/" TARGET=_blank>www.tripoli.org</A>).
Regularly scheduled launches provide a great place to meet other research rocketeers,
launch the motors you have developed, and learn a lot in the process.
Other rocketeers are a most valuable asset, in your pursuit of "Research" rocketry.

<P>
An organization that supports research rocketry exclusively is the Reaction
Research Society, or RRS as commonly referred to. From the RRS webpage
(<A HREF="http://www.rrs.org" TARGET=_blank>www.rrs.org</A>),
"The REACTION RESEARCH SOCIETY, founded in 1943, is the
oldest continuously operating amateur experimental rocketry group in the
United States. With a membership active in all areas of the propulsion
sciences, the Society maintains the largest privately owned rocket test
facility in the country and has, among its membership, many experienced,
state licensed First and Second Class Rocket Pyrotechnic Operators.
Utilizing these facilities and expertise, the RRS is now offering the first
in a series of dedicated rocket propulsion classes for the serious rocketry
enthusiast."

<BR>
"arocket" is an email-based Rocket-Science discussion group. Topics are
broad, encompassing everything from micro-hybrid rocket motors to
record-setting candy motors. Subscribers range from the curious hobbyist to
college professional, and chemical engineers. One of the most
polite/thorough mail lists, it is also the most informative.
Most questions to arocketeers are quickly and concisely answered,
never making one feel out of place. 

<P>
The arocket FAQ page, providing many excellent links to resource material,
includes instructions for subscribing to the mail list.
We highly recommend subscription, if you have any interest in research rocketry whatsoever.
Don't be surprised at the volume of traffic though. arocket has a pretty
sizable and lively knowledge base.
See <A HREF="http://arocket.mid-south.net/library/faq.html" TARGET=_blank>arocket.mid-south.net/library/faq.html</A>.

<P>
Another useful email discussion "list" is called Chemroc.
This list moves much more slowly than arocket, with discussions ranging from
propulsion engineering  to "How to anodize aluminum."  From James E.
Lanier's Gas Dynamics Lab "Amateur" web-page
(<A HREF="http://webpages.charter.net/jelanier/chemroc.html" TARGET=_blank>webpages.charter.net/jelanier/chemroc.html</A>),
"Chemroc is an  e-mail discussion group for amateur rocketeers. All rocket motor
related scientific interests are welcome. The purpose of the group is to
discuss topics with other scientists and amateur scientists for the purpose
of increasing rocket propulsion knowledge. This is NOT a model rocketry
discussion group. This is a scientific discussion group with a primary
interest in propulsion and the chemistry of propulsion. Rocket motors,
chemical processes, measurement theory and testing apparatus are typical
topics." 

<P>
Chemroc is well worth looking in to. Don't choose to subscribe to
arocket over chemroc, subscribe to both.
For subscription details, go to Lanier's Chemroc page,
<A HREF="http://webpages.charter.net/jelanier/chemroc.html" TARGET=_blank>webpages.charter.net/jelanier/chemroc.html</A>.
