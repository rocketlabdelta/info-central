    ALT="comparison of stage and cluster" ALIGN="Right">
<P>
"Clustering" is the use of more than one engine fired at the same time.
Clustering adds together the thrust level, and thus the lifting
or pushing power, of all the engines used. &nbsp; This makes it a good technique
for lifting heavy payloads and large rockets.
<P>
The thrust curve is different from staging. The diagram shows
how. To make your small rocket go twice as high, use two stages. To launch
a much larger rocket to single- stage altitude, use a cluster.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/cluster_bbbvcfly.gif" WIDTH="99" HEIGHT="257" ALT="Bubba V on D12-5 and 2 A10-3T's"
    ALIGN="Left">
<B>What kind of engines?</B>
Almost any single-stage motor.
&nbsp;In some arrangements, all are the same; in others, types can be mixed.
&nbsp; The rocket at left is flying on one D12-5 and two A10-3T's.
<P>
<B>How Many?</B>
Two, three, and four engine clusters are common.
&nbsp;Experienced modelers cluster five, seven, or more sometimes, but more
than four should be considered an advanced technique, because ignition
reliability goes down as more engines are used. &nbsp;The better your power
supply, the more reliable your clusters will be.
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/cluster_clformat.gif" WIDTH="243" HEIGHT="202" ALT="possible cluster layouts"
    ALIGN="Right">
<B>How are they arranged?</B>
Side by side, almost touching.
&nbsp;Two popular arrangements are shown here. The triangular arrangement
of three motors was used in several early Estes kits, and old-timers like
me who remember those rockets (Ranger, Cobra, Scrambler) tend to automatically
think of this arrangement when the word "cluster" comes up. Three Estes BT-20
motor mount tubes cluster neatly in a BT-60.
<P>
However, one central engine with two, three, or four alongside is a valid
and popular format, too, as is a square or diamond-shaped cluster of four.
<P>
If three engines are arranged in a triangle, all need to have
the same thrust curve, or the rocket will be pushed off course. In a square
cluster of four, it's possible to fly with two sets of two, by putting equal
engines on opposite corners. Usually in this kind of arrangement, all the
engines used have the same delay and ejection charge, so that they reinforce
and back up each other.
<P>
If there is a central engine, the others can be inside the main
body with it or can be attached as outboard pods or "strapons." &nbsp;The
outboard engines can be different from the central one, so long as engines
on opposite sides of the centerline are balanced. &nbsp; It's common to put
a long-burning, low thrust "sustainer" in the center and high-thrust, short
burning "booster"* engines outboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;And it's also possible to
completely leave out one engine on each side, or to fly the rocket with only
the central engine in place.
<P>
<I>*In this usage, "booster" does not necessarily mean a zero-delay motor.
It means one designed to get the rocket moving quickly, giving it a "boost."
</I>
<P>
<B>Stability Issues: </B>
Two, three, or more engines at the rear
end of the rocket concentrates weight where it is least wanted and shifts
the CG rearward. &nbsp;Cluster models often need large fins to counteract
this. &nbsp; Be sure to test the stability of a new design with the heaviest
motors you intend to use in it.
<P>
<B>Be Careful of Leakage:</B>
Engines are usually mounted in clustered
motor mount tubes. &nbsp;The spaces between the tubes need to be filled so
ejection charge pressure doesn't leak out there instead of doing its job.
&nbsp;Fill the gaps with a putty made from (1) tissue paper and white glue,
or (2) epoxy and a filler such as microballoons. &nbsp;You could also cut
plywood or balsa plates and glue them in place.
<P>
The outboard engines can have the same delay as the center one,
and reinforce it; or they may be "booster" engines with zero (or short) delay
so that each one ejects itself as it burns out, leaving the center one to
activate recovery; or they may be "plugged" engines that stay in place and
do nothing at all after burnout. &nbsp;In a few cases the outboard engines
may be used to activate the recovery process and the center engine might
be plugged. &nbsp;In the rocket above left, the two A10-3T's are in a special
collar-shaped carrier that ejects and opens its own parachute while the D12-5
is in its coast phase.
<P>
If only part of the cluster is able to activate the recovery system,
take extra care to be sure those motors are ignited. &nbsp;It can be
expensive and embarrassing, not to mention dangerous, if all the engines
fire except the one that opens the parachute. &nbsp;
<P>
<IMG SRC="images/cluster_clwiring.gif" WIDTH="238" HEIGHT="333" ALT="parallel and series wiring"
    ALIGN="Left">
Placing engines on fins or otherwise very far from the centerline
is Not Recommended. If one fires and the others don't, such a rocket
will fly in a high-speed loop.
<P>
<B>How are they wired?</B>
In parallel, so that when one ignitor
burns through, there is still power flowing through the others. If the ignitors
are wired in "series," when one ignitor burns, the circuit is broken.
&nbsp;Notice in the diagram that the ignitors can physically be lined up
alongside each other and still be wired in series. &nbsp;Use of a "clip whip" is recommended.
<P>
<B>Does launching a cluster take extra&nbsp;battery power?</B>
&nbsp;Yes.
&nbsp;A car battery is best. &nbsp;Four fresh alkaline "D" cells or a fully
charged 9.6v RC car battery pack will fire a cluster of three Solar ignitors
or electric matches reliably, but 4 AA cells generally will not. &nbsp;In
general, fully charged NiCad rechargeables are much better than alkalines.
<P>
<B>Clustering and Staging Together:</B> 
<I>Generally Not Recommended.</I>
Usually, if blow-through staging is used to stage from one
cluster to another, the first upper-stage engine to ignite separates the
stages before any others can start. However, there are certain ways staging
and clustering can be combined. A booster stage can have plugged or capped
outboards, while an open-topped central engine fires the single engine in
the upper stage. (John O'Donnell's staged and clustered Fat Boy uses this
method.)&nbsp;Electrical means can be used to fire a cluster in the upper
stage, clearly an advanced technique. &nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have had good
results with a gap-staging methods, and some have used Thermalite or a sprinkle
of loose black powder to interconnect the upper-stage nozzles. &nbsp;George
Gassaway uses CHAD staging so that each booster engine can drop off
independently. &nbsp;Before you attempt this, be sure you understand staging,
clustering, and stability thoroughly, and that you are comfortable with the
power (and expense!) you are turning loose.
<P>
<B>Clustering Composites:</B> &nbsp;Unlike staging, clustering is almost
as easy to do with some composite engines as it is with black powder; but
this should still be considered an advanced technique, if only because <B>a
lot of power will be&nbsp;involved.</B> Some composite propellants are difficult
to ignite, and some kinds of ignitors are unsuitable for clustering. In general,
the smoky, slow-burning composites, such as BlackJack and the Apogee long
burn motors, are more difficult to ignite and unreliable for clustering.
&nbsp;On the other hand, the popular AeroTech G80s, with&nbsp;Blue Thunder
propellant, can be easily clustered if electric matches are used to ignite
them. &nbsp;The pigtails of three or more electric matches can be twisted
together in the manner shown for clip whips.
<P>
