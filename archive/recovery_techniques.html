<P>
In all cases the aim of the recovery system is to slow the rocket down.
All recovery systems decrease the terminal velocity in some way, either
through the properties of aerodynamic drag or aerodynamic lift. It might be
possible to use buoyancy as well, but I've never seen it done.

<P>
Two things to consider. You need to bring the rocket down slow enough
that it presents no danger to itself or others. At the same time, the
longer it takes to get down, the further it will drift in the wind on
the way down. 

<P>
In most cases you're aiming at a 20 fps or slower vertical terminal
velocity. If you fly to 1000' in a 5 mph wind and have a 20 fps descent
rate, you can expect 367' of horizontal drift. You'll get about 734'
with a 10 fps descent rate. The longer it takes, the further it drifts. 

<P>
<B>Featherweight recovery:</B> The rocket is light enough (less than an
ounce typically) that it won't do damage when it hits (Estes Quark is an
example). Or the rocket could have enough drag that it's terminal
velocity is very low (Estes Snitch). Often times the motor is ejected to
make the rocket unstable too. Ejecting motors is not allowed in NAR
contests unless a streamer or parachute is attached to the ejected
motor. 

<P>
<B>Break-Apart recovery:</B> Simply breaking the rocket in the middle
and attaching the two sections by a shock cord will work for many small
rockets. They won't come in streamlined. It would be possible to make
large rockets, with very large surface area and relatively low weight
that would be safe to recover this way. 

<P>
<B>Streamer Recovery:</B> The streamer adds drag and slows the rocket.
The bigger the streamer, the better. Anything over 10 oz will not really
benefit much from a streamer. NAR requires 10 square cm of streamer area
per gram of mass in contest models. Conversion to American units is left
as an exercise to the reader. Streamers run afoul of the principle of
diminishing returns when they are enlarged. Eventually, adding a bigger
streamer will only add a small bit more drag. 

<P>
<B>Parachute Recovery:</B> Using a parachute or parasheet for drag.
Because of the efficiency of parachutes, this is the most popular way.
You get more drag with less cloth than in any other way. NAR requires 5
square cm per gram of mass. Because of this efficiency they are used for
virtually all high power projects. 

<P>
<B>Helicopter Recovery:</B> Using rigid blades and auto-rotation to slow
terminal velocity. Usually the whole rocket must be designed around this
recovery method. This is usually limited to small rockets as the
stresses of a rapidly spinning rocket touching down are enormous. I've
seen and heard of only 1 J800 powered helicopter recovery rocket. Very
spectacular and it sustained damage when it touched down. 

<P>
<B>Gliding Recovery:</B> Using lifting aerodynamic surfaces to control
the terminal velocity. Since the aerodynamic requirements of vertical
flight and gliding flight are usually mutually exclusive, there needs to
be some sort of mass shift to allow transition between vertical flight
and gliding flight. In addition, since the a glider and a rocket are
optimized in mutually exclusive ways, all gliding rockets represent a
compromise between these two competing requirements. Even very large
rockets can be glided down. Many folks use radio control to fly their
gliding recovery rockets. 

<P>
And this is not necessarily all. You could deploy a lighter than air
balloon that slows the rocket's descent. You could have huge air-brakes
deploy from the rocket body. It depends on what you want. 

<P>
Which one is best? It all depends on the rocket and what you're trying
to do with it. For anything over a few ounces, though, parachute
recovery is pretty much the baseline. They are the most efficient for
their weight and bulk.
