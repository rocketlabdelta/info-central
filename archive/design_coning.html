[Editor: "coning" refers to the condition where a rocket
rolls around in a cone shape during its flight.
This is a more complex behavior than simple instability as covered in the CP/CG relationship.]
<P>
"The easy answer is just to quote a term at you: "pitch-roll coupling".
<P>
The more technical answer (in layman's terms) goes like this:
<P>
Have you ever done the gyroscopic motion experiment where you hold a 
spinning bicycle wheel by handles on the axle, and then tilt it to one 
side?  It reacts by tilting 90 degrees to both the direction you 
tilted it and to the axle.
<P>
Think of your long, over stable rocket as a gyroscope initially 
rotating around two axes: around its "roll axis" (the vertical 
centerline of the
Rocket) due to fin misalignments and asymmetrical airfoils, etc., and 
around its "pitch axis" (horizontally into the wind around the CG due 
to weather cocking).
<P>
Due to the way gyroscopic forces work, the pitching moment combines 
with the roll to result in a torque at 90 degrees to either (around the "yaw"
axis, at right angles to the other two axes).  Since the rocket is 
still rolling, the yawing moment causes a similar torque around the 
pitch axis again, this time at right angles to the pitch and roll 
axes, in the opposite direction from the initial weather cocking tilt.  
Of course, now the yawing moment combines with the roll to cause a 
torque around the pitch axis....
<P>
The end result is that the rocket starts swinging its tail and nose 
around in circles, describing a moving cone, with its apex at the 
rocket's CG.  This coning movement naturally reinforces the roll, 
leading to the problem continuing as the rocket ascends.
<P>
What can be done about it?
<P>
Well, first off, make sure your fins are nice and vertical.  If you 
sand airfoils, make sure they are symmetrical.  You don't want the 
rocket to roll much, if at all.  The less it rolls, the lower the 
magnitude of any gyroscopic torques.
<P>
Secondly, try to reduce the "moment of inertia" of your rocket.  Your 
fins are trying to keep the rocket straight.  They apply a limited 
torque due to their force being applied out at the end of a lever arm 
with the fulcrum at the CG.  Now, if your rocket has most of its mass 
near the CG, it will have a lower moment of inertia, and snap back 
into line quicker than a rocket with most of its mass out near the 
nose and tail.  The CG might be in the same place, but imagine 
spinning a three foot dowel with a 1 lb lump of clay at the center, or 
a 3 ft dowel with 8 ounces of clay at each end to see the difference.
<P>
Third, keep the rocket stable, but not overly so.  Remember: the 
rocket rotates (including coning) around its CG.  The farther forward 
of the rocket's center that the CG is, the bigger the circle the tail 
end will describe in the sky when (not if) it cones.
<P>
Making over stable rockets by adding lots of nose weight exacerbates 
the coning problem two ways: it increases the moment of inertia, which 
means you get bigger pitching moments before the fins can counteract 
them, and also means that the gyroscopic effects are larger.  You also 
move the CG forward, so the magnitude of any coning is much worse.
<P>
