    <p>The launch controller shown is designed to handle 6 launch pads. &nbsp; Because the
    panel uses an adjustable rotary switch, the design can easily be expanded to accommodate
    12 pads.&nbsp; The controller has a removable main arming switch, a secondary safety
    switch, and a launch button.&nbsp; It uses red LED&#146;s to indicate pad chosen and green
    LED&#146;s to show igniter continuity.&nbsp; Igniter continuity is continuously displayed
    with igniter standby current of about 13 ma. &nbsp; Arming is indicated with a high
    intensity blinking red LED and an audio alarm. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><img alt="controlback.jpg (29639 bytes)" height="320"
    src="/images/multilauncher_controlback.jpg" width="492"></p>
    <p><strong>Simultaneous launches</strong> are possible using the red switches on the back
    of the control panel.&nbsp; Using the front panel to fire any pad which has a red drag
    race switch turned on will simultaneously fire all others which have their red switch
    turned on. The panel's selection LED's will indicate which pads are chosen for a
    &quot;drag race&quot;.</p>
    <p>The system is designed to minimize the probability of an inadvertent launch caused by a
    short in the wiring leading to the control panel. Power to the relay is supplied from the
    controller panel.</p>

      <li>There is a <strong>safety test button at each pad</strong> on each relay box. It should
        be pressed briefly before connecting the igniters. This will cause an alarm to sound at
        that relay box and a red alarm LED to display if there exists the dangerous condition of
        continuous power at the igniter connectors (i.e. the relay contacts are welded).<br>
      </li>
      <li>Green LED&#146;s (at both the pad and at the launch controller) continually indicate the
        status of igniter continuity. </li>

    <p>If you are new to electronics, please enlist the assistance of someone with experience
    before beginning this project.</p>
    <p>The panel face should be completed with all switches added before wiring is begun.
    &nbsp; LED's should be wired before being glued in place with SuperGlue. </p>
    <p>A simultaneous launch with 6 rockets requires that part of the control wires inside the
    control panel carry the current to operate all 6 relays. <strong>The wire in this portion
    of the circuit must be sized accordingly.</strong> This includes all wire in the circuit
    before it splits off for the individual relays. Other hookup wire in the control panel can
    be 20-22 ga.</p>
    <p><em>Radio Shack part numbers are referenced. However; to keep costs within reason, you
    should consider ordering compatible parts (with the exception of the slope panel box,
    project boxes, and the controller&#146;s blinking LED and low current piezo).&nbsp; It is
    important to use the same type of LED for any LED's which are wired in parallel (i.e.
    igniter continuity in controller and relay box at pad). &nbsp; Mixing LED's with different
    voltage/current specs may cause, one LED to be bright while the other is too dim to view.</em></p>
    <p></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans Serif, Sans Serif" size="-1"
    color="#FF0000"><strong>IMPORTANT DESIGN CHANGE: </strong>Initially, this project had a
    weakness in common with many other controllers.&nbsp; LED's (even high current ones) are <u>very</u>
    difficult to see in direct sunlight if they are made with colored plastic.&nbsp; Recessing
    the LED's, surrounding them with black tubing, placing a hood over them, and/or darkening
    the surrounding faceplate helps little.&nbsp; <strong>REPLACING THEM WITH CLEAR&nbsp;
    LED's COMPLETELY SOLVES THE PROBLEM.</strong>&nbsp; <strong>USE ONLY CLEAR LED's IN THIS
    PROJECT.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans Serif, Sans Serif" size="-1">&nbsp;
    Despite the higher current specs of the clear LED's, CURRENT LIMITING RESISTORS KEEP
    CURRENT LOW AT THE IGNITER (and at the rotary switch during simultaneous launches). &nbsp;</strong>The
    resistors also limit the voltage drop across the igniter during continuity testing.&nbsp;
    To prevent LED dimming when multiple pads are selected, one resistor is now used for each
    LED. &nbsp; (You may wish to substitute a large LED for the Blinking one.&nbsp; Its
    blinking can be inhibited by direct sunlight.)</p>

    <p>1. Print templates using a color inkjet. (Print several extras.)</p>
    <p>2. Temporarily tape a template to the control panel and use a center punch to mark the
    drill holes and insure that their location does not wander during drilling. Drill round
    holes, then cut out rectangular switch hole with a Dremel tool. Mounting the LED&#146;s
    will be much easier if their holes are just a little snug.</p>
    <p>3. Use scotch tape to secure the corners of a self-adhesive laminating sheet (adhesive
    up) to a flat surface.&nbsp; (If you have one, you will find that a 7 ½&quot; airframe
    coupler works better than a flat surface.)</p>
    <p>4. Next you will carefully adhere the printed panel face template (face down) to the to
    the laminating sheet. This is tricky, so, align and adhere one edge and bend the sheet of
    paper as if rolling it on. Slowly and carefully slide a finger back and forth over the
    paper as it meets the laminating sheet. After the entire sheet is laminated, slide your
    finger back and forth across the entire surface while pressing hard. </p>
    <p>5. Cut the templates apart and place them face down on some newsprint. When you spray
    them with adhesive, they will try to curl. You can prevent this with a very light layer of
    adhesive on the newsprint. Spray a light coat onto the back of the paper template.
    Don&#146;t put spray adhesive too thick on back of paper. Spray adhesive on the top of the
    panel cover. Remember to let it dry for about 30 sec so that solvent doesn&#146;t cause
    paper to wrinkle or peel from the plastic while it is drying.</p>
    <p>6. Allow short (10-20 minutes) drying period after adhered.</p>
    <p>7. Trim excess with an Exacto knife. (Holding the panel horizontally and slicing mainly
    downward will yield the best results.) Trim holes similarly. (Practice. If you don&#146;t
    succeed the first time, remove the adhesive with rubbing alcohol or dissolve it with
    turpentine, clean the surface, and try again.)</p>
    <p><img alt="trim.jpg (34529 bytes)" height="337"
    src="/images/multilauncher_trim.jpg" width="500"></p>
    <p>Cut X in screw holes rather than trimming them.</p>
    <p>8. You may want to sand the surface of the clear blinking red LED so that it appears
    frosted. This increases the viewing area for this clear focused LED.&nbsp; An unsanded LED
    is much brighter but is not visible from an angle.</p>
    <p>9. Use a reasonable amount of SuperGlue to mount LED&#146;s. (Excess glue can darken
    the panel face around the hole.) Patiently allow to dry.</p>
    <p>Study the one pad control schematic first. It is included to make the multipad version
    easier to understand. The wiring of the pad relay boxes is identical in both versions.</font></td>

    we launch mostly large scale and smaller models.&nbsp; Any pads located a significant
    distance from the others would benefit from a separate battery (especially if high power
    clusters are used.) &nbsp; The gold colored speaker wire supplies power to each pad.
    &nbsp; <em>Lately, I've seen more people using power cord plugged into receptacles and
    rolled up for storage.&nbsp; This has many advantages including ease of disconnection,
    availability of replacement without repair, cost, etc..&nbsp; Caution should be used if
    this method is used because the plugs could mistakenly be plugged into 110v by launch
    setup personnel or by children at home.</em></p>

    moving launch control away from the publicly accessible area makes it much easier to

    prevent tripping, all control wire fed to a central point near the spider box first then
    fanned out.&nbsp; (Green is control wire. Grey is 12 volt.) </p>
