<A NAME="0"><H1>0</H1>
<P><B>3FNC</B> - Slang for a basic rocket: &quot;3 Fins and a Nose Cone&quot;.
The simplest form a rocket can take is a cylindrical airframe with a pointed or rounded nose, and three stabilizing fins at the rear of the airframe.  The size and shape of the fins, the length and diameter of the airframe, and the shape of the nose are all driven by factors related to motor thrust, internal capacity, stability, and style.  But the simplest (and most nearly drag-free) design for a rocket is three fins and a nose cone.

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE><A NAME="A"><H1>A</H1>
<P><B>Ablation</B> - The flaking and vaporization of material undergoing severe heating due to aerodynamic drag.
In a model or high power rocket the only component that typically undergoes ablation is the motor nozzle.  This is why, even with a reusable motor system (<B>RMS</B>), the nozzle is usually used only once.

<P><B>Accelerometer</B> - An electronic device for detecting the presence of high acceleration.  An accelerometer can be used for flight data gathering, or for controlling flight events.
For example, an accelerometer with a memory chip can record the strength and duration of a rocket’s acceleration.  This data can be used by a computer to calculate the rocket’s approximate altitude at various points of its ascent.
An accelerometer can also be combined with a <B>timer</B> to determine the proper time for a <B>deployment charge</B> or <B>sustainer</B> motor to be activated, by counting down a pre-set number of seconds after acceleration ceases (motor burn-out).

<P><B>Acetate Dope</B> -  A liquid material made from cellulose and acetic acid that shrinks, waterproofs and protects flexible coverings such as tissue or silk.

<P><B>Acetone</B> - An inflammable liquid used as a general solvent for dope, lacquers and epoxy.

<P><B>Airfoil Section</B>- The cross-section of an <B>airfoil</B> in the plane of the common <B>airflow</B> around that part.

<P><B>Airframe</B> - The rocket’s main structure, especially the <B>body tube</B>.

<P><B>Airstart</B> - The practice of starting one or more rocket <B>motors</B> after the rocket is already in the air; a common technique with <B>clustered</B> motors.

<P><B>Alignment</B> -  Bringing parts into position and orientation as desired.

<P><B>Altimeter</B> - A device that measures <B>altitude</B>.  Altimeters can be used simply to document a rocket’s <B>apogee</B>, but they are also commonly used to control electrical devices for <B>airstarting</B> motors or deploying recovery devices.

<P><B>Altitude</B> - Height above the ground.  There are several methods of measuring  or expressing altitude:
<UL>
<LI>Pressure - Read from an altimeter when it is adjusted to 29.92 inches of mercury.  All US aircraft flying above 18,000 AGL use pressure altitudes.
<LI>Actual (also called True) - Height above mean sea level

Example; a K185 motor has a total impulse of approximately 1400 Newton-seconds, and burns for 7.5 seconds.  1387.5 Newton-seconds divided by 7.5 equals 185 <B>newtons</B> average thrust.

<P><B>Axis</B> - One of the three lines of reference around which an aircraft can rotate.  The three movements an aircraft can make (other than moving straight ahead) all involve rotation around some central point.  That point is called an axis.  These movements are:  <B>Roll</B> - rotation around the longitudinal (front-to-back) axis (nose remains pointed forward, but the rocket spins), <B>Pitch</B> - rotation around the horizontal axis (nose moves up or down), and <B>Yaw</B> - rotation around the vertical axis (nose moves left or right.)

<P><B>Azimuth</B> - An angle on a horizontal plane.  See <B>Elevation</B>.

<HR SIZE=1 NOSHADE><A NAME="B"><H1>B</H1>
<P><B>Ballast</B> - Mass added to a model to bring the model into balance by moving the <B>center of gravity</B> forward.  See <B>Stability</B>.

<P><B>Ballistics</B> - Study of objects moving through the air  that have been given a short lived acceleration.

<P><B>Ballistic Coefficient</B> - A rocket’s weight divided by its drag form factor.  The drag form factor is equal to a rocket’s drag coefficient multiplied by its frontal area.  The greater a rocket’s ballistic coefficient, the higher it can coast after finishing the thrust portion of its flight.

<P><B>Ballistic Trajectory</B> - The path a rocket takes when descending without benefit of <B>parachute</B>.  Normally, unless acted upon by wind a rocket’s ballistic trajectory continues to describe a parabolic arc, bringing it to earth nose-first in a relatively predictable location.

<P><B>Barrowman Method</B> - A mathematical technique for calculating the <B>center of pressure</B> of a <B>subsonic</B> rocket at low <B>angles of attack</B>.  Named for James S. Barrowman, who developed the method in 1966.

<P><B>Base Drag</B> -  Drag produced by the airflow moving from the sides to the rear of a model.  As the airflow reaches the rear of a moving rocket’s airframe, it separates from the rocket at the base.  This creates a low-pressure region at the base of the rocket, and impedes its forward motion.  During the powered portion of a rocket’s flight, base drag is reduced by the production of gases from the rocket motor.

<P><B>Baseline</B> - The line between the <B>tracker</B> and the <B>launcher</B> in the single tracker method for finding altitude, or the line between to the tracking stations in the two tracker method.

<P><B>Beam , Structural</B> - A rigid body designed to transmit loads in shear or bending transversely to its point of support. A fin is actually a structural beam.

<P><B>Beeper</B> - A device that produces an auditory signal, assisting searchers to find a rocket after it has landed.

<P><B>B/G</B> - Boost Glider

<P><B>Bernoulli’s Principle</B> - A physics principle that states the pressure exerted by air perpendicular to its direction of travel decreases with an increase in velocity.
This is the theoretical principle upon which airplane wings work.  An airplane wing’s <B>airfoil</B> is unsymmetrical, its upper surface having a greater curve than its lower surface.  This causes air flowing across the upper portion of the wing to speed up, since it must cross a greater surface area in the same length of time.  The increase in air velocity on the upper surface causes the air pressure in the region just above the wing to be reduced.  The higher pressure below the wing presses upward on it, creating lift.

<P><B>Birch</B> - North American hardwood known for its pliancy and tight grain.

<P><B>Black Powder</B> - The original explosive, said to come from China. A mixture of carbon, (charcoal), sulfur and ammonium nitrate (saltpeter).

<P><B>Blackshaft&reg;</B> - A trademarked name for thin-walled body tubing made from phenolic-impregnated paper and used on model rockets built for competition, especially <B>superrocs</B>.  It was prized by some competition rocket flyers because it was stronger than ordinary cardboard tubing, but lighter than fiberglass.  Blackshaft tubing - so called because it was black in color - was sold by Apogee Components.  In some circles it earned the derogatory name &quot;blackshatter&quot; due to its inability to absorb any lateral shock without breaking.  Manufacture of blackshaft tubing was discontinued in 1994.

<P><B>Blade</B> - Long thin <B>wing</B>, rotated around a central hub, such as on a propeller.

<P><B>Blade Twist</B> - The <B>pitch angle</B> variation on a helicopter blade from root to tip.

<P><B>Stab</B> - Stabilizer: Usually refers to the fin-like structures at the rear of a conventional boost glider.

<P><B>Stability</B> - The tendency of a rocket to move in a straight line in the direction it is pointed at launch.
A hobby rocket employs &quot;passive&quot; stability, in that it depends on its inherent stability (the relationship of its centers of pressure and gravity) and the counterbalancing pressure of the <B>airflow</B> on its <B>fins</B> to keep it moving in the correct <B>attitude</B>.  Missiles and spacecraft usually employ &quot;active&quot; stability schemes, in which attitude jets or movable vanes help correct the rocket’s course in flight.
Stability involves a rocket’s ability to continue to fly straight when the <B>angle of attack</B> is greater than zero.  A stable rocket continues to fly in its intended direction, even if moderate wind or other influences try to change its course.
A poorly-designed rocket can be either unstable, marginally stable or excessively stable.  An unstable rocket (whose <B>center of gravity</B> is behind its <B>center of pressure</B>) will fly erratically when launched.  A marginally stable rocket (whose center of gravity is less than one diameter ahead of its center of pressure) might be able to maintain a straight flight attitude if there is no side wind (angle of attack is zero.)  However, if outside forces such as wind intervene (angle of attack greater than zero), the rocket can be thrown off its flight path and behave in an erratic manner.  An excessively stable rocket (whose center of gravity is much more than one diameter ahead of its center of pressure) will tend to turn toward those outside forces rather than remain on the intended line of flight.  See <B>Weathercocking</B>.

<P><B>Stall</B> - The angle of maximum lift for an airfoil. Stalls are dangerous because lift dramatically decreases (often to near zero) at any angle past the stall point

<P><B>Static Margin</B> - The diameter of the thickest part of a rocket’s airframe.  The term is synonymous with &quot;<B>caliber</B>&quot; in determining the relationship between <B>CP</B> and <B>CG</B>.

<P><B>Stine’s Law</B> - The guiding principle of Rocketry construction and flight: &quot;If at first you don’t succeed, try following instructions.&quot;

<P><B>Streamer</B> - A device for slowing the descent of a rocket, sometimes used in place of a <B>parachute</B> in smaller rockets.  The streamer consists of one or more long, narrow lengths of plastic, fabric or paper which are connected to the rocket in the same fashion as a parachute, and which deploy and flutter to slow and stabilize the falling rocket.  Since streamers do not slow the descent as much as a parachute, they are normally only used on relatively small or very robustly-built model rockets.  However, they are useful in windy conditions since they will not allow the descent to drift as much as a parachute will.

<P><B>String Test</B> - See <B>Swing Test</B>.

<P><B>Strip</B> - A condition in which a rocket’s fins, or a glider’s wings, are pulled off the airframe by excess thrust.

Also, a pop-pod glider that separates from the booster pod prematurely.

<P><B>Stuffer Tube</B> - A small-diameter tube - commonly an extension of the motor tube - which is used in large-diameter rocket airframes to duct deployment charge gases to the recovery system storage area.  This reduces the internal area which must be pressurized by the deployment charge.

<P><B>Styrofoam</B> - A very light material made of expanded polystyrene plastic.  Though Styrofoam has little structural strength, is easily shaped into shapes, such as large nose cones and glider wings, that can be skin-reinforced by fiberglassing or lamination of thin wood veneers.

<P><B>SU</B> - Single Use; a disposable motor which cannot be re-used.

<P><B>Subsonic</B> - A speed less than Mach 1.

<P><B>Superroc</B> - Usually, a lengthened version of an existing model rocket design, used in altitude and duration competition. Scoring is based on altitude multiplied by airframe length.  Super-Roc has different length limits for different motor classes.  For example; A has a range of 75 to 150 cm, C has a range of 125-250cm. The rockets can be longer but the excess length is not counted into the length factor. In the altitude category the rocket may be recovered in more than one section.

<P><B>Supersonic</B> - A speed greater than Mach 1 and less than Mach 5.

<P><B>Sustainer</B> - In a multi-stage rocket, the last or top stage.  In a parallel staged rocket, the longest-burning motor.

<P><B>Sweepback</B> - The amount of angle that the leading edge of a wing has been shifted back from a line perpendicular to the airframe of a model.

<P><B>Swing Test</B> - A stability test in which a string is attached to a model rocket at the center of gravity and then swung around the head. If the model is stable, it will head nose into the direction of travel. This test has a large margin of error, thus producing models often overly stable. It can not be used for large rockets, unless King Kong consents to twirl the string.  Sometimes called a <B>string test</B>.

<P><B>Thrust</B> - The propulsive force developed by a rocket <B>motor</B> during the rocket’s powered ascent.
The force produced by a rocket motor is described by Newton’s second law of motion &quot;Force equals mass times acceleration&quot; and by Newton’s third law of motion &quot;for every acting force, there is an equal reacting force in the opposite direction.&quot;  The amount of forward thrust generated by a motor is defined by the second law (F=MXA), the third law merely says that it must move.  In obedience to the second law, the two variables which must be known in predicting a motor’s thrust is the mass of exhaust gas expelled at any given moment, and the exhaust’s velocity.

<P><B>Thrust Decay</B> - The gradual loss of <B>thrust</B> at the end of a motor’s <B>burn</B>.

<P><B>Thrust/Weight Ratio</B> - The relationship between the <B>thrust</B> a rocket’s motor produces and the weight of the rocket at takeoff.  Because hobby rockets do not normally use active stabilization, it is critical that the rocket develop sufficient speed by the time it leaves its <B>launch rod</B> so that the <B>fins</B> can keep it stable.  (See <B>Stability</B>.)  For this reason, it is normally recommended that a rocket’s thrust/weight ratio at takeoff should be at least 5/1.  That is, a rocket that weighs eight ounces at takeoff should use a motor whose initial thrust is at least 40 ounces (2.5 pounds.)

<P><B>Timer</B> - An electronic device which is used to control events during a rocket’s flight, such as <B>sustainer</B> motor ignition or recovery system <B>deployment</B>.  A timer is normally combined with another device such as an <B>accelerometer</B> or <B>G-switch</B>, which provides a start signal for the timer.

<P><B>TTW</B> - Through The Wall; a technique for increasing the strength of a fin-to-airframe mounting joint.  The airframe is slotted at the point where the fin is to be mounted.  The fin is extended or tabbed so that it can pass through the body tube instead of bonding to its surface.  Commonly the root of the fin bonds to the surface of the motor tube, then fillets are built up where the fin passes through the airframe.

<P><B>Tube Fins</B> - Tubes attached to the trailing end of a rocket <B>airframe</B>, used in place of <B>fins</B>.

<P><B>Tube Launched</B> - A rocket - often having some form of folding <B>fins</B> - which is supported at launch by a tube or box rather than by a <B>launch rod</B> or rail.

<P><B>Tumble Recovery</B> - A recovery method where a very light model rocket ejects its motor and shifts its <B>CG</B> behind the <B>CP</B>, thus preventing stable flight and causing the model to tumble end over end.

<P><B>Tunnel</B> - Slang for wind tunnel.

Also, a long hollow conduit on the side of a rocket used to protect wiring traveling from the top to the bottom of the rocket.

<P><B>Turbulator</B> - A device used on rockets with conical cross-sections, such as <B>egg lofters</B>, to prevent the extra drag which occurs when the <B>laminar airflow</B> separates from the airframe.  This is done by causing the airflow to become turbulent at the point where it would normally separate from the airframe.

<P><B>Two-Stage Recovery</B> - A process by which a rocket is recovered by means of a <B>streamer</B> or <B>drogue</B> <B>parachute</B> which opens at <B>apogee</B>, followed by a main parachute which opens at lower <B>altitude</B>.  See <B>Single-Stage Recovery</B>.

This is achieved by canting the motor’s exhaust nozzle, and is often done to reduce the unsymmetrical thrust that results from outboard motors failing to ignite on clustered-motor rockets.

<P><B>Von Karmon</B> - A nose cone shape.  Von Karmon is a special case of the <B>Sears-Haack</B> series of nose cone shapes, used on very high-speed rockets.  It is the most efficient volume per unit nose drag.
