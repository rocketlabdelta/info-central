<B>New prize!</B>  In mid-February, another name will be drawn from the INFOcentral
contributors (all contributors through that time).  The same prizes are being offered:
your choice of a Dynacom
<A HREF="http://www.dynacom-inc.com/widow.htm">Black Widow</A>
kit or a set of AeroTech 54mm hardware (Dr. Rocket RMS 54/852-1706 System).
Contribute early and often!-->

<P>
<SMALL>FINE PRINT:</SMALL>
These prizes are run like raffles: each article published in INFOcentral will earn the
author a "raffle ticket" (this includes articles published before the raffle starts).
A few days after the ending date, a ticket will be randomly chosen and that ticket holder will
choose their prize from the offerings for that raffle.
Due to the uncertainty of delivery time from some manufacturers (such as Dynacom),
we cannot guarantee a delivery date.
However, the prizes will be purchased and shipped as quickly as possible after
the raffle ends.
