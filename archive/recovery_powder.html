<FONT FACE="Arial, Helvetica, MS Sans Serif, Sans Serif" SIZE=-1>
Black powder ("BP") is used in ejection charges. BP is available in
different grain sizes. FFFFg (4F) 
powder is usually used. FFFg (3F) is also sometimes used.
<P>
An important concept is that a little too much BP is better than 
any amount of too little. Precise measurement is not necessary,
is part because different batches of BP are not exactly identical,
and one batch may burn slightly better than another batch.
If a calculation suggests 2.3 grams then 2.5 grams will be fine,
but 2.0 grams may not be enough. Far too much BP can result
in a large force that can tear a rocket apart. A simple way to
compensate for a "hefty" ejection charge is a long tether so that
rocket parts have a chance to decelerate before reaching the end of
the tether.
<P>
Ground testing is recommended. Ground testing can reveal
the minimum amount of BP that will reliably eject a recovery system
until ideal conditions. Ideal conditions rarely exist during a flight
as airframe and/or coupler may flex and bind, a parachute may expand
during boost due to G forces and fit tighter in the airframe, and 
temperature changes can occur that affect the fit of components.
<P>
Factors that affect the amount of BP that will be needed are listed
below.
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Diameter of airframe (base of nose cone)
	<LI>Volume of parachute chamber
	<LI>How tightly parts (airframe/coupler) fit
	<LI>Leakiness of the airframe
</UL>
<P>
The mass of parts, such as a nose cone, isn't taken into account as
hobby rocket components generally have low mass compared to non-hobby rockets.
<P>
The larger an airframe's diameter the greater the amount of force that
will be placed on the base of the nose cone. For example, assume a
4" diameter airframe. The surface area of the nose cone's base is
2 * 2 * 3.14 = 12.5 square inches. If the ejection charge produces
10 pounds per square inch (psi) then the force on the base on the nose
cone will be 12.5 * 10 = 125 pounds. An ejection charge sized for
10 psi in a 6" diameter airframe would put 282 pounds of force on
the nose cone. Therefore a simple psi value is not sufficient, and 
the desired pounds per square inch usually needs to be adjusted 
for airframe diameter. Larger diameter airframes can often use a
lower pressure (psi) than smaller diameter airframes.
<P>
The volume of the recovery section determines the amount of BP to
reach a desired pressure (pounds per square inch).
<P>
Tight fitting parts can need more force than loosely fitting parts
to separate them. If shear pins are used to retain the nose cone then
the force needed to break them needs to be known and taken into account.
For example, about
35 pounds is needed to break a #2 nylon screw used as a shear pin to
retain the nose cone. (The amount of force to shear a #2 nylon
screw varies and depends upon the hardness and sharpness of the materials
through which the screw extends. Filament wound fiberglass tubes are harder
and the edges sharper than cardboard airframe tubes, for example, and
less force may be needed to shear a pin when filament would fiberglass tubes
are used. Shear pins are described in another part of InfoCentral as well as below.)
<P>
A leaky airframe allows gas to escape before it performs useful work.
A recovery system that uses a piston puts more of the gas from
burned BP to use to expell the recovery system. Therefore less BP 
can usually be used when a piston is used. If a rocket kit uses a piston
and the manufacturer recommends the amount of BP to use then follow the
manufacturer's recommendation.
<P>
A starting point for determining the amount of BP to use is to determine
the amount of desired force on the base of the nose cone. A suggested 
value is 150-200 pounds. The next step is to determine the amount of
pressure (pounds per square inch - psi) that will produce the desired
amount of force. A table showing psi for different airframe diameters
and desired force is <a href="#ejection"><FONT SIZE=-1 FACE="Arial, Helvetica, 
MS Sans Serif, Sans Serif">shown below</FONT></A>.

<P>
The table shows that smaller diameter airframes may need a higher pressure
than larger diameter airframes.
<P>
Once you've selected a desired force (150, 200 or 250 pounds) on the nose cone,
determine the psi that will produce that force. For example, 16 psi will put
200 pounds of force on the nose cone of a 4" diameter rocket. 
<P>
Now determine the amount of BP to produce the desired pressure.
An equation is shown below.
<P>
<CENTER><B>C * D * D * L = grams of BP</B></CENTER>
<P>
<UL>
        <LI>C - one of the values listed below
        <UL>
		<LI>0.002 = 5 psi
                <LI>0.004 = 10 psi
                <LI>0.006 = 15 psi
                <LI>0.0072 = 18 psi
		<LI>0.008 = 20 psi
        </UL>
        <LI>D = airframe diameter, in inches
        <LI>L = length of the cavity to be pressurized, in inches
</UL>
<P>
Example: 6" diameter airframe, 22" long parachute compartment, 7 psi
<P>
The tables don't have a value for 7 psi. However, a little too much is
better than any amount of too little. Therefore select 10 psi (C = 0.004).
<P>
0.004 * 6 * 6 * 22 = 3 grams BP
<P>
The next step is ground testing. Ground testing can reveal the minimum
amount needed under ideal conditions. It is usually best to not fly with the
minimum amount of BP that works under ideal conditions. Assume that you
calculate that 3 grams of BP are needed. Ground testing shows that 2 grams
is the minimum amount for a reliable deployment. You will probably want to use
3-4 grams during flight.
<P>
Some high altitude flights have experienced recovery system ejection
problems. The cause may be that BP may not combust as well at 30,000 feet
as it does at sea level, or the rockets may have used components (nose cone,
parachute) with a much greater mass than typical hobby high power rockets, and
therefore the methodology for hobby rockets may not apply to significantly more
massive rockets.
<P>
None of this information applies to BP substitutes like Pyrodex or smokeless
powers, which generally don't work with rocket recovery systems.

<a name="ejection"></a><H4>Shear Pins and Ejection Charges</H4>
<P>
Shear pins are being used more frequently these days as a reliable means of holding 
the nosecone (and payload bay in a dual deployment rocket) on the airframe during 
flight. The use of shear pins avoids the possibility of drag seperation during flight. 
Jim Jannuzzo, ROL Construction Forum moderator, found that #2 nylon screws (2-56) make excellent 
shear pins, reliably shearing under 35 pounds of force. That force must be generated 
by the ejection charge. The ejection charge force is calculated by multiplying the 
cross-sectional area of the body tube by the ejection charge pressure in psi. Divide 
this force by 35 pounds to get the maximum number of shear pins that can be used. 
Don't use less than two shear pins because it's possible the nosecone can cock to one 
side and jam if you only use one. You can also use #4 nylon screws (4-40) but they tend to
deform raw phenolic tubing. 4-40 shear pins are best used with fiberglass tubing.
The ejection charge calculator below will calculate the maximum number of shear pins 
that can be used for a given ejection charge.

<H4>The theory behind the numbers:</H4>

If you've never had a rocket crash because the parachute didn't come out right, go on to read something else. But if you know what the term "core sampling" is from experience, here is some good information.
<P>

Parachute failure often comes from an incorrect or insufficient amount of ejection charge. This is caused by either having too large a parachute compartment inside the rocket, or not using the right amount of black powder in a reloadable motor.

<P>Ejection charge weight can be calculated based on the desired ejection pressure and the internal "free-volume" of the rocket airframe. Normally the volume of the parachute and rigging inside is neglected. This approach is used in industry for closed bomb calculations and pulsar (pressure cartridge) applications.

<P>First you need to determine the required pressure to separate and deploy the recovery system. This depends on the area of the bulkhead, hence body diameter, and the mass of the nose section. The force from the pressure must be enough to overcome the inertia and drive the mass of the nose section the length of the coupler inside the tube to the point of separation, plus a little more for momentum to fully deploy everything. If you consider the nose having to deploy into a wind, or not near apogee, you need a little more push again.

<P>Assume that the gas expands and the pressure occurs instantly and uniformly throughout the volume. The pressure exerts an instant force on the forward bulkhead intended for extention. Neglect any change in pressure and temperature from the change in volume as the nose moves forward, (unless you just like calculus.) This is the simplest case for a single set of variables and adequate for most ejection systems. <

<P>The ejection charge equation is:

<P>
<CENTER><B>Wp = dP * V / R * T </B></CENTER>

<P>where:
<UL>
<LI TYPE=square>dP is the ejection charge pressure in psi.
<LI TYPE=square>R is the combustion gas constant, 22.16 (ft- lbf/lbm R) for FFFF black powder. (Multiply by 12 in/ft to get in terms of inches.)
<LI TYPE=square> T is the combustion gas temperature, 3307 degrees R for black powder.
<LI TYPE=square> V is the free volume in cubic inches. Volume of a cylinder is cross section area times length L, or from diameter D, V = L * pi * D2/4
<LI TYPE=square>Wp is the charge weight (mass, actually) in pounds. (Multiply by 454 gm/lb to get grams.)
</UL>

Here's an example calculation. Suppose you want to generate 15 psi inside a 4" diameter rocket in a parachute compartment 18" long. That makes a volume of 226 in3. The amount of powder you need will be:
<P>
<CENTER><B>Wp = 15 * 226(454) / 12 (22.16) 3307

<P>
Wp = 1.75 grams
<P>
</CENTER>
</B>

The equation can be turned around to find what pressure is produced by a given charge mass. So that you won't have to think, it's just
<P>
<CENTER><B>dP = Wp * R * T / V </B></CENTER>
<P>

Now, so you will have to think, given the ejection charge mass in a D12 motor is .85 grams, what pressure is generated inside an Estes Phoenix model, with a 2.4" diameter and 8" long chute compartment?

<P>From this relationship of parameters, you can better design the amount of recovery space in your rocket, or customize the amount of powder to successfully deploy the system.

<P>Of course, since you're being this careful to determine the correct charge amount, you'll want to verify it by a ground test. That way you can get a better handle on other less precise variables like nose coupler friction inside the tube and necessary shock cord length. But how to do that is another article!
