<P>
Except in cases of willfulness or those in which the public interest requires
otherwise, and the regional director (compliance) so alleges in the notice
of denial of an application or revocation of a license or permit, no license
or permit will be revoked or renewal application denied without first calling
to the attention of the licensee or permittee the reasons for the contemplated
action and affording him an opportunity to demonstrate or achieve compliance
with all lawful requirements and to submit facts, arguments, or proposals
of adjustment. The notice of contemplated action, ATF F 540O.12, will afford
the licensee or permittee 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice
to respond. If no response is received within the 15 ,days, or if after
consideration of relevant matters presented by the licensee or permittee,
the regional director (compliance) finds that the licensee or permittee is
not likely to abide by the law and regulations, he will proceed as provided
in <A HREF="#SS55.74">&#0167; 55.74</A>. <BR>

<P>
Whenever the regional director (compliance) has reason to believe that an
applicant for an original license or permit is not eligible to receive a
license or permit under the provisions of <A HREF="subpartd.html#SS55.49">&#0167;
55.49</A>, he shall issue a notice of denial on ATF F 5400.1 1. The notice
will set forth the matters of fact and law relied upon in determining that
the application should be denied, and will afford the applicant 15 days from
the date of receipt of the notice in which to request a hearing to review
the denial. If no request for a hearing is filed within that time, a copy
of the application, marked Disapproved", will be returned to the applicant.

<P>
If the applicant for an original license or permit desires a hearing, he
shall file a request with the regional director (compliance) within 15 days
after receipt of the notice of denial. The request should include a statement
of the reasons for a hearing. On receipt of the request, the regional director
(compliance) shall refer the matter to an administrative law judge who shall
set a time and place (see <A HREF="#SS55.77">&#0167; 55.77</A>) for a hearing
and shall serve notice of the hearing upon the applicant and the regional
director (compliance) at least 10 days in advance of the hearing date. <P>
The hearing will be conducted in accordance with the hearing procedures
prescribed in Part 200 of this chapter (see <A HREF="#SS55.82">&#0167; 55.82</A>).
Within a reasonable time after the conclusion of the hearing, and as expeditiously as possible,
the administrative law judge shall render his recommended decision. He shall
certify to the complete record of the proceedings before him and shall
immediately forward the complete certified record, together with four copies
of his recommended decision, to the regional director (compliance) for decision.

that the licensee or permittee is not likely to comply with the law or
regulations or is otherwise not eligible to continue operations authorized
under his license or permit, the regional director (compliance) shall issue
a notice of denial of the renewal application or revocation of the license
or permit, ATF F 5400.11 or ATF F 5400.10, as appropriate. In either case,
the notice will set forth the matters of fact constituting the violations
specified, dates, places, and the sections of law and regulations violated.
The notice will, in the case of revocation of a license or permit, specify
the date on which the action is effective, which date will be on or after
the date the notice is served on the licensee or permittee. The notice will
also advise the licensee or permittee that he may, within 15 days after receipt
of the notice, request a hearing and, if applicable, a stay of the effective
date of the revocation of his license or permit. <BR>

application or revocation of license or permit. </BIG></B>
<P>
If a licensee or permittee whose renewal application has been denied or whose
license or permit has been revoked desires a hearing, he shall file a request
for a hearing with the regional director (compliance). In the case of the
revocation of a license or permit, he may include a request for a stay of
the effective date of the revocation. On receipt of the request the regional
director (compliance) shall advise the licensee or permittee whether the
stay of the effective date of the revocation is granted. If the stay of the
effective date of the revocation is granted, the regional director (compliance)
shall refer the matter to an administrative law judge who shall set a time
and place (see <A HREF="#SS55.77">&#0167; 55.77</A>) for a hearing and shall serve
notice of the hearing upon the licensee or permittee and the regional director
(compliance) at least 10 days in advance of the hearing date. If the stay
of the effective date of the revocation is denied, the licensee or permittee
may request an immediate hearing. In this event, the regional director
(compliance) shall immediately refer the matter to an administrative law
judge who shall set a date and place for a hearing, which date shall be no
later than 10 days from the date the licensee or permittee requested an immediate
hearing. The hearing will be held in accordance with the applicable provisions
of Part 200 of this chapter. Within a reasonable time after the conclusion
of the hearing, and as expeditiously as possible, the administrative law
judge shall render his decision. He shall certify to the complete record
of the proceeding before him and shall immediately forward the complete certified
record, together with two copies of his decision, to the regional director
(compliance), serve one copy of his decision on the licensee or permittee
or his counsel, and transmit a copy to the Attorney for the Government. <BR>

</BIG></B>
<P>
(a) Initial application proceedings. If, upon receipt of the record and the
recommended decision of the administrative law judge, the regional director
(compliance) decides that the license or permit should be issued, the regional
director (compliance) shall cause the application to be approved, briefly
stating, for the record, his reasons. If he contemplates that the denial
should stand, he shall serve a copy of the administrative law judge's recommended
decision on the applicant, informing the applicant of his contemplated action
and affording the applicant not more than 10 days in which to submit proposed
findings and conclusions or exceptions to the recommended decision with
supporting reasons. <P>
If the regional director (compliance), after consideration of the record
of the hearing and of any proposed findings, conclusions, or exceptions filed
with him by the applicant, approves the findings, conclusions and recommended
decision of the administrative law judge, the regional director (compliance)
shall cause the license or permit to be issued or disapprove the application
accordingly. <P>
If he disapproves the findings, conclusions, and recommendation of the
administrative law judge, in whole or in part, he shall by order make such
findings and conclusions as in his opinion are warranted by the law and the
facts in the record. Any decision of the regional director (compliance) ordering
the disapproval of an initial application for a license or permit shall state
the findings and conclusions upon which it is based, including his ruling
upon each proposed finding, conclusion, and exception to the administrative
law judge's recommended decision, together with a statement of his findings
and conclusions, and reasons or basis for his findings and conclusions, upon
all material issues of fact, law or discretion presented on the record. A
signed duplicate original of the decision will be served upon the applicant
and the original copy containing certificate of service will be placed in
the official record of the proceedings. <P>
If the decision of the regional director (compliance) is in favor of the
applicant, he shall issue the license or permit, to be effective on issuance.
<P>
(b) Renewal application and revocation proceedings. <BR>
Upon receipt of the complete certified records of the hearing, the regional
director (compliance) shall enter an order confirming the revocation of the
license or permit, or disapproving the application, in accordance with the
administrative law judge's findings and decision, unless he disagrees with
the findings and decision. A signed duplicate original of the order, ATF
F 5400.9, will be served upon the licensee or permittee and the original
copy containing certificate of service will be placed in the official record
of the proceedings. If the regional director (compliance) disagrees with
the findings and decision of the administrative law judge, he shall file
a petition with the Director for review of the findings and decision, as
provided in <A HREF="#SS55.79">&#0167; 55.79</A>. <P>
In either case, if the renewal application denial is sustained, a copy of
the application marked "Disapproved" will be returned to the applicant. If
the renewal application denial is reversed, a license or permit will be issued
to become effective on expiration of the license or permit being renewed,
or on the date of issuance, whichever is later. If the proceedings involve
the revocation of a license or permit which expired before a decision is
in favor of the licensee or permittee, the regional director (compliance)
shall: 
<DL>
  <DT>
    (1) If renewal application was timely filed and a stay of the effective date
    of the revocation was granted, cause to be issued a license or permit effective
    on the date of issuance; <BR>
    (2) If renewal application was not timely filed but a stay of the effective
    date of the revocation had been granted, request that a renewal application
    be filed and, following that, cause to be issued a license or permit to be
    effective on issuance; or, <BR>
    (3) If a stay of the effective date of the revocation had not been granted,
    request that an application be filed as provided in
    <A HREF="subpartd.html#SS55.49">&#0167; 55.45</A>, and process it in the same manner
    as for an application for an original license or permit. 
</DL>
<P>
(c) Curtailment of stay of revocation effective date. <BR>
If, after approval of a request for a stay of the effective date of an order
revoking a license or permit but before actions are completed under this
subpart, the regional director (compliance) finds that it is contrary to
the public interest for the licensee or permittee to continue the operations
or activities covered by his license or permit, the regional director
(compliance) may issue a notice of withdrawal of the approval, effective
on the date of issuance. Notice of withdrawal will be served upon the licensee
or permittee in the manner provided in <A HREF="#SS55.81">&#0167; 55.81</A>. <BR>
