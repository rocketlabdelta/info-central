(a) <I>Alternate methods or procedures</I>. The permittee or licensee, on
specific approval by the Director as provided by this paragraph, may use

    shall automatically terminate the authority for the variations and the licensee
    or permittee shall fully comply with the prescribed requirements of regulations
    from which the variations were authorized. Authority for any variation may
    be withdrawn whenever, in the judgment of the Director, the effective
    administration of this part is hindered by the continuation of the variation.
    Where the licensee or permittee desires to employ an emergency variation,
    he shall submit a written application to the regional director (compliance)
    for transmittal to the Director The application shall describe the proposed
    variation and set forth the reasons for it. Variations may not be employed
