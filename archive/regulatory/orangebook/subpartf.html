<B><BIG><A NAME="SS55.101">&#0167; 55.101 Posting of license or permit.</BIG></B><P>
A license or permit issued under this part, or a copy of a license or permit,
will be posted and available for inspection on the business premises at each
place where explosive materials are manufactured, imported, or distributed.
<BR>
<P>
<B><BIG><A NAME="SS55.102">&#0167; 55.102 Authorized operations by permittees and certain licensees.</BIG></B><P>
(a) In general. <BR>
The license issued to a manufacturer-limited does not authorize that licensee
to engage in another class of business required to be licensed under the
Act or this part. Therefore, if a licensed manufacturer-limited intends to
manufacture explosive materials for purposes of sale or distribution or to
deal in explosive materials, he shall qualify for the appropriate license.
Similarly, a permit issued under this part does not authorize the permittee
to engage in the business of manufacturing, importing, or dealing in explosive
materials. Accordingly, if a permittee's operations bring him within the
definition of a manufacturer, importer, or dealer under this part, he shall
qualify for the appropriate license. <BR>
(b) Distributions of surplus stocks. <BR>
Licensed manufacturers-limited and permittees are not authorized to engage
in the business of sale or distribution of explosive materials. However,
these licensees or permittees may dispose of surplus stocks of explosive
materials to other licensees or permittees in accordance with &#0167; 55.103,
and to nonlicensees or to nonpermittees in accordance with &#0167; 55.105(d).
<BR>
<P>
<B><BIG><A NAME="SS55.103">&#0167; 55.103 Transactions among licensees/permittees.</BIG></B>
<P>
(a) General. <BR>
(1) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer or licensed dealer selling
or otherwise distributing explosive materials (or a permittee or a licensed
manufacturer-limited disposing of surplus stock to another licensee or permittee) who has the certified information required
by this section may sell or distribute explosive materials to a licensee
or permittee for not more than 45 days following the expiration date of the
distributee's license or permit, unless the distributor knows or has reason
to believe that the distributee's authority to continue business or operations
under this part has been terminated. <BR>
(2) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer or licensed dealer selling
or otherwise distributing explosive materials (or a permittee or a licensed
manufacturer-limited disposing of surplus stock to another licensee or permittee)
shall verify the license or permit status of the distributes prior to the
release of explosive materials ordered, as required by this section. <BR>
(3) Licensees or permittees desiring to return explosive materials to a licensed
manufacturer may do so without obtaining a certified copy of the manufacturer's
license. <BR>
(4) Where possession of explosive materials is transferred at the distributor's
premises, the distributor shall in all instances verify the identity of the
person accepting possession on behalf of the distributee before relinquishing
possession. Before the delivery at the distributor's premises of explosive
materials to an employee of a licensee or permittee, or to an employee of
a carrier transporting explosive materials to a licensee or permittee, the
distributor delivering explosive materials shall obtain an executed ATF F
5400.8 from the employee before releasing the explosive materials. The ATF
F 5400.8 must contain all of the information required on the form and required
by this part. <BR>
<P>
Example 1. An ATF F 5400.8 is required when: <BR>
a. An employee of the purchaser takes possession at the distributor's premises.
<BR>
b. An employee of a carrier hired by the purchaser takes possession at the
distributor's premises. <BR>
Example 2. An ATF F 5400.8 is not required when: <BR>
a. An employee of the distributor takes possession of the explosives for
the purpose of transport to the purchaser. <BR>
b. An employee of a carrier hired by the distributor takes possession of
the explosives for the purpose of transport to the purchaser. <P>

(b) License/permit verification of individuals. <BR>
(1) The distributes shall furnish a certified copy <BR>
(or, in the case of a user-limited, the original) of the license or permit.
The certified copy need be furnished only once during the current term of
the license or permit. Also, a licensee need not furnish certified copies
of licenses to other licensed locations operated by such licensee. <BR>
(2) The distributor may obtain any additional verification as the distributor
deems necessary. <P>
(c) License/permit verification of business organizations. <BR>
(1) A business organization may (in lieu of furnishing a certified copy of
a license) furnish the distributor a certified list which contains the name,
address, license number and date of license expiration of each licensed
location. The certified list need be furnished only once during the current
term of the license or permit. Also, a business organization need not furnish
a certified list to other licensed locations operated by such business
organization. <BR>
(2) A business organization shall, prior to ordering explosive materials,
furnish the licensee or permittee a current certified list of the representatives
or agents authorized to order explosive materials on behalf of the business
organization showing the name, address, and date and place of birth of each
representative or agent. A licensee or permittee shall not distribute explosive
materials to a business organization on the order of a person who does not
appear on the certified list of representatives or agents and, if the person
does appear on the certified list, the licensee or permittee shall verify
the identity of such person. <P>
(d) Licensee/permittee certified statement. <BR>
(1) A licensee or permittee ordering explosive <BR>
materials from another licensee or permittee shall furnish a current, certified
statement of the intended use of the explosive materials; e.g., resale, mining,
quarrying, agriculture, construction, road building, oil well drilling,
seismographic research, to the distributor. <BR>
(2) For individuals, the certified statement of intended use must specify
the name, address, date and lace of birth, and social security number of
the distributes. <BR>
(3) For business organizations, the certified statement of intended use must
specify the taxpayer identification number, the identity and the principal
and local places of business. <BR>
(4) The licensee or permittee purchasing explosive materials need revise
the furnished copy of the certified statement only when the information is
no longer current. <BR>
<P>
(e) User-limited permit transactions. <BR>
A user-limited permit issued under the provisions of this part is valid for
only a single purchase transaction and is not renewable (see &#167; 55.51). Accordingly,
at the time a user-limited permittee orders explosive materials, the licensed
distributor shall write on the front of the user- limited permit the transaction
date, his signature, and the distributor's license number prior to returning
the permit to the user-limited permittee. <BR>
<P>
<B><BIG><A NAME="SS55.104">&#0167; 55.104 Certified copy of license or permit.</BIG></B><P>
Except in the case of a nonrenewable user's permit (see &#167; 55.43 and &#167; 55.51),
each person issued a license or permit under this part who desires an additional
copy of his license or permit for certification and for use under &#0167; 55.103,
shall, <BR>
(a) Make a reproduction of his license or permit and execute the certification
on it; <BR>

for certified copies of his license or permit to the Chief, Firearms and
Explosives Licensing Center. The request will show the name, trade name (if
any), and address of the licensee or permittee and the number of copies of
the license or permit desired. There is a fee of $1 for each copy of a license
or permit issued by the Chief, Firearms and Explosives Licensing Center,
under this paragraph. <P>
Fee payment must accompany each request for additional copies of a license
or permit. The fee must be paid by money order or check made payable to the
Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms. <BR>

<B><BIG><A NAME="SS55.105">&#0167; 55.105 Distributions to nonlicensees and nonpermittees.</BIG></B><P>
(a) This section will apply in any case where distribution of explosive materials
to the distributes is not otherwise prohibited by the Act or this part. <P>
(b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, a licensed importer,
licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer may distribute explosive materials
to a nonlicensee or nonpermittee if the nonlicensee or nonpermittee is a
resident of the same State in which the licensee's business premises are
located, and the nonlicensee or nonpermittee furnishes to the licensee the
explosives transaction record, ATF F 5400.4, required by &#0167; 55.126. Disposition
of ATF F 5400.4 will be made in accordance with &#0167; 55.126. 
<P>
(c) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer may sell
or distribute explosive materials to a resident of a State contiguous to
the State in which the licensee's place of business is located if the purchaser's

of a State contiguous to the State in which the licensee's or permittee's
place of business or operations are located, and if the requirements of
paragraphs (b), (c), (e) and (f) of this section are fully met. <P>
(e) A licensed importer, licensed manufacturer, or licensed dealer selling
or otherwise distributing explosive materials to a business entity shall
verify the identity of the representative or agent of the business entity
who is authorized to order explosive materials on behalf of the business
entity. Each business entity ordering explosive materials shall furnish the
distributing licensee prior to or with the first order of explosive materials
a current certified list of the names of representatives or agents authorized
to order explosive materials on behalf of the business entity. The business
entity ordering explosive materials is responsible for keeping the certified

or nonpermittee, the distributor delivering explosive materials shall obtain
an executed ATF F 5400.8 from the employee before releasing the explosive
materials. The ATF F 5400.8 must contain all of the information required
on the form and by this part. (See examples in &#0167; 55.103(a).) <BR>
