<B><BIG>Introduction </BIG></B>
<P>
The following Questions and Answers are intended to aid you in gaining a
better understanding of: <A HREF="18usc40.html">18 U.S.C.
Chapter 40</A>-importation, Manufacture, Distribution and Storage of Explosive
Materials ... and of the implementing regulations issued within: <BR>
27 CFR Part 55 - Commerce in Explosives. 
<P>
Although the listing is by no means all-inclusive, it does contain a selection
of those Questions that ATF receives most often about explosives. A Table
of Contents reflects the broad categories into which the Questions have been
grouped, and a Subject Index has been included for your convenience. 
<P>
These Questions and Answers apply only to Federal law and regulations. The
States and their local jurisdictions have, in many cases, enacted their own
requirements relating to explosives. <BR>
<P>
Public Law 93-639, approved January 4, 1975, amended the language contained
in <A HREF="18usc40.html"#845>18 U.S.C. &#167; 845(a)(5) </A>which
had excepted any "black powder in quantities not to exceed five pounds",
from the law. This amendment: 
<DL>
  <DT>
    Removed Federal controls over commercially manufactured black powder in
    quantities of 50 pounds or less (and other items specified therein) intended
    to be used solely for sporting, recreational, or cultural purposes in antique
    firearms or antique devices, thereby removing black powder acquired under
    this exemption from all Federal regulations under Part 55; and <BR>
    Extended the Federal licensing provisions of
    <A HREF="18usc40.html"#843>18 U.S.C. &#167; 843</A> to include
    any person selling or distributing black powder regardless of quantity. <BR>
</DL>
<P>
<B><BIG>Discussion </BIG></B>
<P>
The exemption contained in <A HREF="18usc40.html"#845>&#167; 845(a)(5)
</A>applies to most retail sales of black powder. Licensees have the obligation
in conducting these sales to establish to their own satisfaction that persons
wanting to acquire black powder under the exemption intend to use the powder
solely for exempted sporting, recreational, or cultural purposes. Transaction
records are required for nonexempt sales. For example, sales of black powder
to nonlicensees/nonpermittees in quantities exceeding 50 pounds, or in any
quantity when not intended for use as exempted by the law, require the completion
of ATF Form 5400.4, Explosives Transaction Record
(<A HREF="subpartg.html"#SS55.126>&#167; 55.126</A>). Other
requirements in 27 CFR Part 55 include: 
<UL>
  <LI>
    Storage of black powder by licensees in accordance with
    <A HREF="subpartk.html"#SS55.201>Subpart K (&#167; 55.201</A>,
    ff.); and, 
  <LI>
    Entries for black powder in the daily summary of magazine transactions
    (<A HREF="subpartg.html"#SS55.127>&#167; 55.127</A>). <BR>
</UL>
<P>
Additionally ... <BR>
<B>Compliance with Federal law and regulations in no way exempts persons
from compliance with State and local requirements. </B><BR>
[Under the exemption a nonlicensee/nonpermittee may import commercially
manufactured black powder in quantity not to exceed 50 pounds
(<A HREF="subpartf.html"#SS55.108>&#167; 55.108(b)</A>). There
is no ATF form to deliver to customs and an individual importing under the
exemption has to comply with customs procedure at the port of entry.] <BR>

</DL>
<P>
B. Other Unlawful Distributions: A licensee shall not knowingly distribute
any explosive materials to any person who:
<DL>
  <DT>
    (1) The licensee knows or has reason to believe does not reside in the State
    in which the licensee's place of business is located (unless a "contiguous
    State" provision applies. [See <A HREF="#q&amp;a4">Question # 4</A>.])
    [<A HREF="#842b3">18 U.S.C. 842(b)(3)</A>]; <BR>

    at the place of distribution [<A HREF="#842e">18 U.S.C. 842(e)</A>]; <BR>
    (3) The licensee has reason to believe intends to transport the explosive
    materials into a State where the purchase, possession, or use of explosive
    materials is prohibited or which does not permit its residents to transport
    or ship explosive materials into the State or to receive explosive materials
    in the State [<A HREF="#842c">18 U.S.C. 842(c)</A>]; Or, <BR>
    (4) The licensee has reasonable cause to believe intends to use the explosive
    materials for other than a lawful purpose. [<A HREF="#SS55.106">&#167; 55.106</A>]
    <BR>
</DL>
<P>
<B><I>3. Does the law prevent some persons from dealing in explosives?</I></B> <P>
Yes. The same classes of persons listed in Answer A to <A HREF="#q&amp;a2">Question
#2 </A>may not obtain a Federal explosives license. In addition, prospective
licensees must meet the other requirements set forth in <A HREF="#SS55.49">&#167;
55.49</A>. [See <A HREF="#q&amp;a19">Question 19</A>.] <BR>
<P>
<B><I><A NAME="q&amp;a4">4. </A>How does the law affect your dispositions to
persons who do not have a license or permit? </I></B>
<P>
A person who has not acquired a permit from the Federal Government may, if
not barred as discussed in Questions # 2 and 3, purchase explosives only
in the State in which he resides. There are two exceptions:
<DL>
  <DT>
    (1) Interstate purchases without permits are allowed if the purchaser's State
    of residence has passed specific legislation allowing its citizens to transport
    into, or receive in, that State explosive materials purchased in a bordering,
    or "contiguous," State; and <BR>
    (2) No form is required for the purchase of up to 50 pounds of black powder
    for sporting, recreational, or cultural purposes in antique firearms or antique
    devices. [<A HREF="subpartf.html"#SS55.105>&#167; 55.105</A>]
</DL>
<P>
<B><I><A NAME="q&amp;a5">5. </A>What States allow their citizens to purchase
explosive materials in bordering States? </I></B>
<P>
Please contact your State Attorney General or State Fire Marshal, whichever
is appropriate, for a definitive answer. States of Delaware, Kentucky, Vermont,
Washington, and Wyoming are understood to allow such purchases for black
powder, only.
<P>
<B><I>6. When a person purchases explosives, does he have to sign anything?
</I></B>
<P>
Yes. ATF Form 5400.4 will be executed by the buyer for purchases of high
and low explosives, and blasting agents. A Federal explosives licensee or
permittee who purchases explosive materials is not required to complete Form
5400.4. [<A HREF="subpartg.html"#SS55.126>&#167; 55.126</A>].<BR>
<P>
<B><I>7. Does Federal law and regulations provide penalties for purchasers who
give false information to a licensee at the time of purchase? </I></B>

is a maximum 10 years' imprisonment and/or a $10,000 fine.
[<A HREF="subparti.html"#SS55.162>&#167; 55.162</A>]
<P>
<B><I>8. When a person purchases explosive materials, is the Federal Government
notified? </I></B>
<P>
No. The executed Form 5400.4 remains on the dealer's premises.
[<A HREF="subpartg.html"#SS55.126>&#167; 55.126</A>] <BR>
<P>
<B><I>9. Are thefts of explosives covered by the law? </I></B>
<P>
Yes. Any person discovering a theft or loss of explosive materials from stock
must, report it to ATF, and to the appropriate local authority within 24
hours. Also, it is unlawful to receive, conceal, transport, ship, store,
barter, sell, or dispose of any explosive materials knowing or having reasonable
cause to believe that such explosive materials were stolen. 
<P>
<P>
<B>10.<I> Will anyone investigate accidents involving explosives?</I></B>
<P>
ATF is authorized to inspect the site of any accident or fire where there
is reason to believe that explosive materials were involved. Other Federal
agencies, or State or Local agencies, might also investigate such incidents,
depending on the circumstances. [<A HREF="subpartc.html#SS55.31">&#167; 55.31</A>]

ATF Form 5400.13/5400.16 must be filed to obtain a license or permit.
[<A HREF="subpartd.html"#SS55.45>&#167; 55.45</A>]
<P>
<B><I>20. Does a Federal license or permit exempt the holder from State or local
requirements? </I></B>
<P>
No. A license or permit confers no right or privilege to conduct business
or operations, including storage, contrary to State or other law.
[<A HREF="subpartd.html"#SS55.62>&#167; 55.62</A>] Where a situation
arises that State or local requirements are more stringent than the Federal,

55.49</A>] <BR>
<P>
<B><I>25. What may a licensed dealer do?</I></B>
<P>
A licensed dealer may engage in the business of distributing explosive materials
at wholesale or retail. [<A HREF="subpartb.html"#SS55.11>&#167;
55.11</A>: Definition of 'dealer'.] <BR>
<P>
<B><I>26. What may a licensed importer do? </I></B>
<P>
A licensed importer may engage in the business of importing or bringing explosive
materials into the United States for sale or distribution.
<A HREF="subpartb.html"#SS55.11>[&#167; 55.11</A>: Definition
of 'importer'] It is not necessary for a licensed importer to also obtain
a dealer's license in order to engage in business on his licensed premises
as a dealer in explosive materials.
[<A HREF="subpartd.html"#SS55.41>&#167; 55.41</A>] <BR>
<P>
<B><I>27. How may I import explosives? </I></B>
<P>
Any licensed importer or permittee may import explosives by providing the

<A HREF="subpartf.html"#SS55.108>55.108</A>] <BR>
Note, however, that in the case of propellant powder or other components
of small arms ammunition, an approved ATF Form 6 must be provided to the
Customs Service. [27 CFR &#167; 178.113] Also, see Question 56. <BR>
<P>
<B><I>28. What may a licensed manufacturer do? </I></B>
<P>
Licensed manufacturers may engage in the business of manufacturing explosive
materials for purposes of sale or distribution, or for their own use; BUT,
a licensed manufacturer-limited may manufacture explosive materials for his
own use, only. <BR>
[<A HREF="subpartb.html"#SS55.11>&#167; 55.11</A> ] It is not
necessary for a licensed manufacturer to also obtain a dealer's license in
order to engage in business on his licensed premises as a dealer in explosive
materials. [<A HREF="subpartd.html"#SS55.41>&#167; 55.41</A> ]
<BR>
<P>
<B><I>29. Is a separate license required for each location where business is

<P>
Yes. A separate license is required for each location where business is
conducted. However, a separate license is not required for: 
<DL>
  <DT>
    (1) Facilities used only for the storage of explosive materials; and, <BR>
    (2) A location used solely for the storage of records relating to the business.
    [&#167; 55.411 
</DL>
<P>
<B><I>30. Must a person who engages in the business of both manufacturing and
importing at the same location have both licenses? </I></B>
<P>
Yes. The licenses for manufacturing and importing allow a person to do separate
and distinct things, and a separate license is required for each activity.
However, a manufacturer or an importer does not need a separate dealer's
license in order to also distribute explosive materials from his licensed
premises. [<A HREF="subpartd.html"#SS55.41>&#167; 55.41</A>] <BR>
<P>
<B><I>31. Does a licensed manufacturer need a separate license for his own on-site
manufacturing? </I></B>
<P>
No. As long as the on-site manufacturing takes place in the ATF Region in
which the manufacturer's license is held.
[<A HREF="subpartd.html"#SS55.41>&#167; 55.41</A>] <BR>
<P>
<B><I>32. Are companies having headquarters in one State but doing business
in another State required to have a permit in order to acquire explosive
materials in the latter State? </I></B>
<P>
No. Companies engaged in business within a State acquire residency in that
State by virtue of the work being performed (but check out the State and
local requirements). Explosives purchases made by these companies in the
State where work is being performed are considered by ATF to have been made
within their State of residence; therefore, no permit is required. [ATF Ruling
76-4] <BR>
<P>
<B><I>33. Does a licensed dealer need a permit to use explosives outside the
State in which his business premises is located? </I></B>
<P>
No. The dealer, by virtue of his license, is authorized to acquire and to
transport explosives in interstate commerce.

<P>
<B><I>35. When an explosives licensee/permittee sends his truck driver to the
distributor's premises for explosives which have been purchased by the
licensee/permittee, will the driver be required to sign any forms? </I></B>
<P>
The driver will be required to identify himself and to complete and sign
Section A of Form 5400.8. [<A HREF="subpartf.html"#SS55.103>&#167;
55.103</A>] <BR>
<P>
<B><I>36. Will a licensee or permittee be notified in advance when his license
or permit needs to be renewed? </I></B>
<P>
Yes. Prior to expiration of the license or permit, a licensee or permittee
will be notified by way of ATF Form 5400.14/5400.15, Part III, "Renewal of
Explosives License or Permit," an application form which must be completed
and timely filed in order to effect renewal.
[<A HREF="subpartd.html"#SS55.46>&#167; 55.46</A>] <BR>
<P>
<B><I>37. 1 have timely filed my application for renewal but I have not received
my renewed license or permit. May I continue in business? If so, how long?
</I></B>
<P>
Yes. You may continue to operate pursuant to your current license or permit
until the application for renewal is acted upon. 118 U.S.C. 558] <BR>
<P>
<B><I>38. When may sales of explosives by licensed dealers be made to residents
of adjoining States? </I></B>
<P>

<P>
<BIG><A NAME="Recordkeeping">Recordkeeping </A></BIG><BR>
<P>
<I><B>39. Does a person who obtains a license or permit have to keep records of
explosive materials transactions?</B></I> <P>
Yes. A licensee or permittee must keep records of all acquisitions and
dispositions of explosive materials. [&#167; 55.1071 <BR>
<P>
<B><I>40. How does one account for explosive materials in his records?</I></B> <P>
If acquisitions are recorded by weight, then disbursements must also be recorded
by weight. If acquisitions are recorded by physical count, then disbursements
must also be recorded by physical count. <BR>
<P>
<I><B>41. Must a licensee or permittee maintain a daily summary of magazine
transactions? </B></I><P>
Yes. After the initial inventory required by regulations has been taken,
the inventory shall be entered in a record of daily transactions. At the
close of business each day, explosives shall be recorded by class, in accordance
with the three classes set forth in &#167; 55.202, as to the total quantity received
in and removed from each magazine during the day and as to totals remaining
on hand at the end of each day. [&#167; 55-127] <BR>
<P>
<I><B>42. Must I keep my explosives records on the site of the magazine to which
these records pertain? </B></I><P>
No. A licensee or permittee proprietor of an approved explosives storage
facility may keep the records required by &#167; 55.127 at a centrally located
area on the premises, provided a separate record of daily transactions for
each magazine is maintained. <BR>
<P>
<B><I>43. When must a report be made of a shortage or theft of explosive materials?</I></B>
<P>
Any discrepancy which might indicate a theft or loss shall, within 24 hours,
be reported by telephone to ATF (toll free: 800-424-9555). Licensees and
permittees must confirm the report by filing a completed Form 5400.5 with
the nearest ATF District Office. All other persons must confirm the report
by letter to the nearest ATF Office. A report must also be made to local
authorities. [&#167; 55.30, 55.1651 <BR>
<P>
<B><I>44. Where may I obtain additional copies of ATF Form 5400.4? </I></B><P>
