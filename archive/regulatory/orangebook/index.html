<P>
Title XI of the Organized Crime Control Act of 1970 (18 U.S.C. Chapter 40)
establishes controls over explosive materials, including black powder and
other pyrotechnic compositions commonly used in fireworks. Part 55 of Title
27, Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), contains the regulations which implement
Title XI. <A HREF="subparth.html#SS55.141">&#167; 55.141</A>(a)(7) exempts "the
importation and distribution of fireworks classified as Class C explosives
and generally known as 'common fireworks,' and other Class C explosives,
as described by U.S. Department of Transportation regulations in 49 CFR 173
.100(p),(r),(t),(u), and (x)." <P>
<A HREF="subparth.html#SS55.141">&#167; 55.141</A>(a)(7) does not exempt "special
fireworks" (often referred to as "display fireworks") which are classified
by the Department of Transportation as Class "B" explosives. The exemption
applies only to "common fireworks" in a finished state classified by the
Department of Transportation as Class "C" explosives (49 CFR &#167; 173.100).
<BR>
<P>
<B>With Respect to Fireworks ... Who Needs a License?</B>
<OL>
  <LI>Manufacturers of black powder;
  <LI>Manufacturers of any other explosive material used in manufacturing "special fireworks" (Class "B" explosives) or "common fireworks" (Class "C" explosives); and
  <LI>Importers of, or dealers in, "special fireworks." 
</OL>
<P>
<B>With Respect to Fireworks ... Who Needs a Permit?</B>
<OL>
  <LI>A person acquiring or transporting "special fireworks" interstate for his own use and not for resale. [Agencies of the United States or of any State or political subdivisions thereof are exempt from permit requirements.]; and
  <LI>A person, other than a licensee, acquiring or transporting explosive materials interstate for use in manufacturing "special fireworks" or "common fireworks.
</OL>
<P>
<B>With Respect to Fireworks ... Who May Not Need a License or Permit?</B>
<P>
Frequently, persons contracting for display fireworks (such as would be
appropriate for Fourth of July observances) from an out-of-State dealer receive
a total service, including the services of a pyrotechnician who transports
display fireworks in interstate commerce to the site of the display and conducts
or supervises the display. In these instances, the customers purchase the
dealer's services rather than the explosive materials themselves, and the
cost of the services includes the dealer's expense in providing the fireworks
utilized. When business is transacted in this manner, the customers purchasing
and receiving the services need not obtain Federal licenses or permits since
they are not actually acquiring explosive materials outside their States
of residence, and they are not receiving such materials or causing them to
be transported in interstate commerce. If the dealer furnishing the services
is a licensee, his interstate transportation of explosive materials to the
display sites would be conduct authorized by his license. <BR>
<P>
<B>With Respect to Fireworks ... Types of Permits</B>
<OL>
  <LI>User permit: Allows a permittee to acquire, transport, ship and receive "special fireworks" in interstate or foreign commerce for his own use and not for resale. This permit is issued at a cost of $20 for a one-year period and is renewable at a cost of $10 for a three-year period.
  <LI>User-limited permit: Identical to the user permit but issued for a single transaction, only. The fee is $2; the permit is nonrenewable. A new permit must be obtained for each transaction. This type of permit is advantageous to civic and veterans organizations who wish to conduct a single display such as on the Fourth of July.
</OL>
<P>
<B>With Respect to Fireworks ... Storage</B>
<P>
The law prohibits any person from storing any explosive materials in a manner
not in conformity with the regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the
Treasury (1 8 U.S.C. <A HREF="#842">842</A>(J)). Pursuant to this section,
the Secretary has prescribed storage regulations in 27 CFR Part 55, Subpart
K. Since display fireworks are not exempt from regulations, they must be
stored in conformity with the regulations. Display fireworks generally contain
Perchlorate mixture explosives, potassium chlorate base explosive mixtures,
and black powder, which are entered on the List of Explosive Materials with
numerous others. (The List is annually compiled and readily available without
charge from the address set out in <A HREF="subpartc.html#SS55.23">&#167;
55.23</A>.) <P>
Display fireworks should be stored as low explosives in facilities meeting
the requirements for type 4 storage facilities, prescribed by
<A HREF="subpartk.html#SS55.210">27 CFR &#167; 55.210 </A>unless they contain
other classes of explosives. <P>
The manufacturer of exempt or nonexempt fireworks having stocks of explosive
materials on hand to be used in the manufacture of fireworks must store his
stocks in conformity with applicable storage requirements. In storage facilities
where weight restrictions apply, the net weight of the explosive materials
may be used. To determine the actual weight of the explosive materials, it
may be necessary to contact their manufacturers. <BR>
