Requirements for descriptions of explosives storage facilities. <P>
ATF Proc. 75-4 
<P>
This Procedure (which was incorporated in Industry Circular 75-10; effective
November 1, 1975) revised requirements for descriptions of explosives storage
facilities that must be filed by applicants intending to store explosive
materials. <P>

The Director, ATF, determined that this additional descriptive information
was and is required in order to ensure compliance with the law and regulations.
Accordingly, Forms 4705 and 4707 (now ATF F 5400.13/5400.16, "Application
For License or Permit") were revised. Following is the text of the Procedure,
as amended: 
<P>
<B>Secs. 3 &amp; 4. Licenses and Permits.</B>
<P>
A person intending to engage
in business as an importer, manufacturer or dealer in explosive materials,
or who is intending to acquire, transport, ship, import or receive explosive
materials in interstate or foreign commerce for his own use and not for resale,
shall complete ATF F 5400.13/5400.16, "Application For License or Permit,"
in accordance with the instructions on the form, and forward the form with
the license or permit fee to the office specified on the form. If approved,
the Chief, Firearms and Explosives Licensing Center will issue a license
or permit to the applicant. At the time of renewal of a license or permit,
the Chief, Firearms and Explosives Licensing Center may require the filing
of a new or amended application, or additional descriptive pages, to be attached
to the application upon a determination that the currently approved application
is inaccurate or does not fully describe the storage facilities. If the
application is denied, the applicant will be advised in writing of the reasons
for the denial. 
<P>
<B>Sec. 5. Storage. </B>
<DL>
  <DT>
    .01 If explosive materials are to be stored, the requirements of 27 CFR Part
    55, Subpart K- Storage, must be complied with before the application will
    be approved. An applicant for a license or permit who intends to store explosive
    materials shall fully describe the intended storage facilities to support
    the applicant's affirmation that the storage facilities meet the requirements
    set forth in 27 CFR Part 55, Subpart K-Storage. <BR>
    .02 The description should, as a minimum, include the following information:
  <DD>
    (a) The type of magazine (building, igloo, tunnel, portable box, portable
    trailer, etc.). <BR>
    (b) The location and distance from applicant's place of business. <BR>
    (c) The distance to the next nearest storage magazine. <BR>
    (d) A description of significant terrain features and physical structures,
    such as buildings, roads, utilities and other facilities which could be damaged
    if the magazine exploded. Indicate the distance between the magazine and
    the feature. <BR>
    (e) The materials (including dimensions and thicknesses) used for the structure
    (e.g., concrete, corrugated iron over wood, plywood, tin and earth, etc.).
    <BR>
    (f) The security, physical safeguards, locks, safety equipment, and anti-theft
    measures. <BR>
    (g) The dimensions and capacity of each magazine. <BR>
    (h) The class of explosive materials to be stored in each magazine. <BR>
    (I) The owner(s) of the magazine, if other than the applicant. <BR>
    (j) The names and telephone numbers of individuals who could open the magazines
    for inspection by ATF officers. <BR>
    (k) Any special conditions, such as inaccessibility in winter, etc. 
</DL>
<P>
(1) [ADDENDUM] A diagram of the premises, providing much of the required,
descriptive information set out above. (Preparation by an engineer is not
required.) [75 CB 791]
<P>
<A NAME="2"><B><BIG>(2) 27 CFR 55.1 1: MEANING OF TERMS
</BIG></B></A><BR>
(Also &#167; 55.206) 
<P>
An office or repair shop used in connection with the manufacture, etc. of
explosive materials is not an "inhabited building." <P>
ATF Rul. 75-20 <BR>
<P>
ATF has held that a building, such as an office or repair shop, which is
a part of the premises of an explosives manufacturer and is used in connection
with the manufacture, transportation, storage, or use of explosive materials,
is not an "inhabited building." &#167; 55.11 of 27 CFR defines inhabited building
as "any building regularly occupied in whole or in part as a habitation for
human beings, or any church, schoolhouse, railroad station, store, or other
structure where people are accustomed to assemble, except any building occupied
in connection with the manufacture, transportation, storage, or use of explosive
materials." <P>
Regulations in 27 CFR 55.206 and &#167; 55.218 set forth provisions concerning
the location of storage facilities and the minimum distances such storage
facilities may be located from, among other things, "inhabited buildings."
<P>
These provisions are intended to provide protection to persons who inhabit
buildings located near premises where explosives are manufactured, stored,
etc. However, it is the intent of &#167; 55.1 1 to exempt buildings used by the
explosives industry in connection with the manufacture, transportation, storage,
or use of explosive materials from the table of distance requirements on
"inhabited buildings." [75 CB 64]
<P>
<B><BIG><A NAME="3">(3) 27 CFR 55.207: CONSTRUCTION OF TYPE 1 MAGAZINES
</A></BIG></B><BR>
(Also &#167; 55.210) 
<P>
Certain explosives storage facilities meeting standards of construction
prescribed by the Department of Defense Explosives Safety Board for such
storage are approved by the Bureau. 
<P>
ATF Rul. 75-21
<P>
ATF has held that explosives storage facilities with smooth-finished concrete
floors that were constructed under contract for the use of the Department
of Defense (DOD) and that are presently being leased to licensees and permittees
for the storage of commercial explosives are considered to be in compliance
with the requirements for nonsparking floors, as set forth in 27 CFR 55.207(a)(4), 55.207(b), and &#167; 55.210, for the storage of all types of fully
packaged explosives, pyrotechnics and propellants, with the exception of
black powder. Any other such magazines which have smooth finished concrete
floors and which meet or exceed DOD construction specifications will also
be considered to be in compliance with the requirements of Part 55 with respect
to nonsparking floors. 
<P>
It is the responsibility of the licensee or permittee to provide verification
that such facilities were manufactured under DOD specifications or that the
facilities meet or exceed such specification standards. 
<P>
If the regional director (compliance) determines that the concrete floors
of <A HREF="storage.html#Type1">type 1</A> or <A HREF="storage.html#Type4">type
4</A> magazines do not meet the preceding requirements, he will require such
floors to be covered with a nonsparking material, such as epoxy paint or
mastic. 175 CB 67]
<P>
<B><BIG><A NAME="4">(4) 27 CFR 55.41: LICENSES AND PERMITS - GENERAL
</A></BIG></B>
<P>
Certain companies that manufacture explosive materials for use in their own
operations are required to obtain licenses as manufacturers of explosive
materials. 
<P>
ATF Rul. 75-31
<P>
ATF has held that companies, such as public utility companies engaged in
line and facility construction, which manufacture explosives on a regular
or continual basis are considered to be engaged in the business of manufacturing
explosive materials and must be appropriately licensed as required by
<A HREF="18usc40.html#842">18 U.S.C. 842.</A> 
<P>
The term "manufacturer" is defined in <A HREF="18usc40.html#841">18 U.S.C.
841(h)</A> as "any person engaged in the business of manufacturing explosive
materials for purposes of sale or distribution or for his own use." 
<P>
Although the term "engaged in the business" is not susceptible to a rigid
definition within<A HREF="18usc40.html"> 18 U.S.C. &#167; 841-848</A>, it is
interpreted to imply an element of continuity or habitual practice; an element
clearly present in the operations of companies described herein. <BR>
Therefore, these companies are considered to be engaged in the business"
and must be licensed as explosives manufacturers. [75 CB 65] 
<P>
<B><BIG><A NAME="5">(5) 27 CFR 55.109-IDENTIFICATION OF EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS
</A></BIG></B>
<P>
Methods of marking containers of explosive materials are prescribed.
<P>
ATF Rul. 75-35 
<P>
ATF has held that any method or combination of methods for affixing the required
marks to the immediate container of explosive materials, or outside container
used in the packaging thereof, is authorized provided the identifying marks:
<DL>
  <DT>
    (1) Are legible; <BR>
    (2) Show all required information; and, <BR>
    (3) Are not rendered indecipherable by extended periods of storage. 
</DL>
<P>
Where it is desired to utilize a coding system and to omit printed markings
on the container, a letterhead application displaying the coding to be used
and the manner of its application shall be filed with and approved by the
Director, ATF, prior to the use of the proposed coding. Further, where a
manufacturer operates his plant for only one shift during the day, the shift
of manufacture need not be shown. <P>
It was found that liquid components of explosive materials stored for a period
of time in polyethylene or other soft containers would seep through the container
walls, tending to render illegible the inked, identifying marks on the container.
A manufacturer's proposal [subsequently approved] of using a system of perforated
numbers and code symbols (similar that used on cancelled checks) to mark
containers in addition to other identifying marks stamped in ink, was determined
to continue to provide the identification required by 27 CFR 55 .109, even
if the ink later became illegible. [75 CB 65]
<P>
<B><BIG><A NAME="6">(6) 27 CFR 55.1 1: MEANING OF TERMS - STATE OF RESIDENCE
</A></BIG></B>
<P>
"State of residence" of business entities who use explosive materials;
distribution of explosive materials by licensees to out-of-State business
entities other than licensees and permittees; and, distribution to nonresident
employees of such entities are discussed.
<P>
ATF Rul. 76-4 
<P>
ATF was asked to interpret the term "State of residence" (in
<A HREF="subpartb.html#SS55.11">&#167; 55.11</A>) as it: 
<DL>
  <DT>
    (1) Pertains to the distribution of explosive materials to out-of-State
    corporations and other business entities other than licensees and permittees;
    and <BR>
    (2) Relates to the distribution of explosive materials to nonresident employees
    of such business entities. 
</DL>
<P>
<B>The Business Entity </B>
<P>
If a person is a corporation or other business entity, "State of residence"
means the State in which such corporation or other business entity maintains
a "place of business." A business entity establishing another "place of business"
or "job site" in another State would acquire a "State of residence" in that
State as well. This means that a company engaged in construction work would
acquire a residence in each State wherein its work is performed. Its place
of business in those States would be the job sites at which business is carried
on. It would not be essential to a determination of its State of residence
that a branch office be maintained in, or administrative work be performed
in, the States where job sites are located. <P>
Such a company would not need a permit to acquire explosive materials from
a licensee in a State for use at job sites located therein. Form 5400.4,
"Explosives Transaction Record," would show the out-of-State address of the
business entity 
as the principal place of business, and the location of the job site as the
local place of business. 
<P>
<B>Nonresident Employees </B>
<P>
The purpose of the data requested on Form 5400.4 is to identify the person
authorized by the business entity to make the purchase of explosive materials
on the entity's behalf and to assure the distributor that such person appears
on the required certified list of names of representatives or agents authorized
by the business entity to acquire the materials. Regulations (27 CFR 55.105(e)), implementing Title <A HREF="18usc40.html#842f">18, U.S.C.
842(f)</A>, in part, provide that each business entity acquiring explosive
materials shall furnish the distributing licensed dealer with a current,
certified list of the names of representatives or agents authorized to acquire
explosive materials on behalf of such business entity. The purpose of the
data requested on Form 5400.8, "Explosives Delivery Record," is to identify
the employee of the business entity or the employee of a carrier accepting
delivery of explosive materials on behalf of the distributes at the distributor's
business premises. <P>
Therefore: 
<DL>
  <DT>
    In the case of business entities, the information required on ATF Forms 5400.4
    and 5400.8 with respect to employees or agents arranging for the distribution
    is not for the purpose of establishing the residence of such persons but
    only for identification purposes. [76 CB 104] 
</DL>
<P>
<P>
<B><BIG><A NAME="7">(7) 27 CFR 55.126: EXPLOSIVES TRANSACTION RECORD
</A></BIG></B>
<P>
Under certain conditions, a single Form 5400.4 may be used to cover a series
of deliveries. 
<P>
ATF Rul. 76-10 
<P>
Under the provisions of 27 CFR 55 .126, a sale or other distribution by
a licensee or permittee shall not be made to a nonlicensee or nonpermittee
unless the transaction is recorded on a Form 5400.4. Under certain conditions,
a single Form 5400.4 may be used to cover a series of deliveries. When an initial sale
has been consummated, with partial deliveries to be made in the immediate
future, the requirements of &#167; 55.126 will have been satisfied if the following
steps are taken: 
<DL>
  <DT>
    (1) Form 5400.4 shall be executed at the time the sale is initially made,
    although delivery of the explosive material is extended over a period of
    time not to exceed 30 days. <BR>
    (2) The executed Form 5400.4 shall subsequently be noted to accurately reflect
    the date of each separate delivery and describe each separate lot of explosive
    materials delivered. <BR>
    (3) In lieu of showing the separate deliveries on the Form 5400.4, the proprietor
    may attach to the executed form a copy of the delivery record or a copy of
    the bill of lading or commercial invoice covering each delivery; provided
    that, as to each such delivery, the attachment contains the date of the delivery
    and all the information required by Item 21 of Form 5400.4. <BR>
    (4) All other regulatory requirements and instructions relating to the completion
    of the form must be complied with. [76 CB 105] 
</DL>
<P>
<B><A NAME="8">(8) 27 CFR 55.207: CONSTRUCTION OF TYPE 1 STORAGE FACILITIES
</A></B><BR>
(Also &#167; 55.208) 
<P>
Alternate construction standards for storage facilities for explosive materials
are prescribed.
<P>
ATF Rul. 76-18 
<P>
<A HREF="18usc40.html#842j">Section 842(j)</A> of 18 U.S.C. states: "It shall
be unlawful for any person to store any explosive material in a manner not
in conformity with regulations promulgated by the Secretary. In promulgating
such regulations, the Secretary shall take into consideration the class,
type, and quantity of explosive materials to be stored, as well as the standards
of safety and security recognized in the explosives industry." <P>
The regulations in 27 CFR 55.207 and 55.208 prescribe types of storage
facilities for explosive materials and provide (among other things) that
such storage facilities shall be bullet-resistant. &#167; 55.201(b) provides
that alternate storage facilities may be authorized for the storage of explosive
materials when it is shown that such alternate facilities are or will be
constructed in a manner substantially equivalent to the standards of construction
contained in the applicable regulations.
<P>
The term "bullet-resistant" means resistant to penetration of a bullet of
150 grain M2 ball ammunition having a nominal muzzle velocity of 2700 feet
per second fired from a .30 caliber rifle from a distance of 100 feet
perpendicular to the wall or door. <P>
It has been determined that a wide range of construction criteria meet the
bullet-resistant requirements of regulations for construction of storage
facilities for explosive materials. 
<P>
In order to promote standards of safety and security in the storage of explosive
materials while allowing the industry a wide latitude in the selection of
construction materials, it is held that storage facilities (magazines) that
are constructed according to the following minimum specifications are
bullet-resistant and meet the requirements of the regulations as set forth
in 27 CFR Part 55. (All steel and wood dimensions indicated are actual
thicknesses. To meet the concrete block and brick dimensions indicated, the
manufacturers' represented thicknesses may be used.) 
<DL>
  <DT>
    (a) Exterior of 5/8 inch steel, lined with an interior of any type of nonsparking
    material. <BR>

<B><A NAME="9">(9) 27 CFR 55.30: REPORTING THEFT OR LOSS OF EXPLOSIVE MATERIALS
</A></B><BR>
(Also &#167; 55.165) 
<P>
Reporting theft or loss of explosive materials.
<P>
ATF Rul. 77-13 
<P>
Section 842(k) of 18 U.S.C. makes it unlawful for any person who has knowledge
of the theft or loss of any explosive materials from his stock to fail to
report such theft or loss within 24 hours of discovery thereof to ATF and
to appropriate local authorities. Regulations at 27 CFR 55.30, implementing
section 842(k), require that the report of theft or loss be made by telephone
and in writing to ATF <P>
The legislative history of Title XI of the Organized Crime Control Act of
1970 (18 U.S.C. Chapter 40) makes clear the Congress believed that total
coverage of all stolen explosive materials was necessary for the effective
operation of any Federal explosives regulatory statute-because of the special
problems presented by such stolen explosive materials and the persons possessing
them, The statute and the regulations refer to the reporting of thefts or
losses of explosive materials from the "stock" of a person. With reference
to that requirement, the House Judiciary Committee report makes it clear
that this provision was intended to place an affirmative duty on all possessors
of explosive materials to report a theft or loss of such explosive materials.
Thus, the reporting requirements were not meant to apply only to thefts or
losses from business inventories. 
<P>
It is, therefore, held that all persons possessing explosive materials who
suffer a theft or loss of such materials shall report the theft or loss within
24 hours after the discovery thereof to ATF and to appropriate local authorities.
Such persons required to report include (but are not limited to) licensees,
permittees, carriers who transport or otherwise possess explosive materials,
and users of such materials. Licensees and permittees must make such report
by: 
<DL>
  <DT>
    First, calling ATF toll free at 800-424-9555; <BR>
    Second, calling the local law enforcement office; and <BR>
    Third, completing and forwarding ATF Form 5400.5 in accordance with instructions
    on the form. 
</DL>
<P>
All other persons subject to the reporting requirement must report by telephone
and in writing, by letter, to the nearest ATF Office. [177 CB 190] <BR>
<P>
<BIG><A NAME="10">(10) 27 CFR 55.213: QUANTITY AND STORAGE RESTRICTIONS
</A></BIG><BR>
(Also &#167; 55.208)
<P>
Alternate magazine construction standards for storage of electric blasting
caps with other explosive materials are prescribed. 
<P>
ATF Rul. 77-24 
<P>
Section 8420) of 18 U.S.C. states: "It shall be unlawful for any person to
store any explosive material in a manner not in conformity with regulations
promulgated by the Secretary. In promulgating such regulations, the Secretary
shall take into consideration the class, type, and quantity of explosive
materials to be stored, as well as the standards of safety and security
recognized in the explosives industry." <P>
The regulations in 27 CFR 55.213 restrict the storage of blasting caps
with other explosive materials. &#167; 55.201 (b) provides that alternate storage
magazines may be authorized for the storage of explosive materials when it
is shown that such alternate magazines are or will be constructed in a manner
substantially equivalent to the standards of construction contained in the
applicable regulations. <P>
ATF recognizes that the transportation and storage of explosive materials
in the same vehicle along with electric blasting caps is often desired. The
Institute of Makers of Explosives established a recommended standard for
such transport in their Safety Library Publication No. 22, dated November
5, 1971 [revised January 1985]. This standard prescribes the minimum construction
criteria for: 
<DL>
  <DT>
    (a) A container securely attached 
  <DD>
    (1) Above the cab of the vehicle (see Figure 1, Appendix A), and <BR>
    (2) To the vehicle frame under the cargo space (see Figure 2, Appendix A),
    or 
  <DT>
    (b) A built-in compartment in the cargo space of the vehicle (see Appendix
    B). <BR>
    In addition to motorized vehicles, consideration was also given for the use
    of similar criteria on portable wheeled trailers being used as magazines
    under &#167; 55 .208(a) of the regulations (see Appendix E). 
</DL>
<P>
In order to insure standards of safety and security in the storage of explosive
materials while allowing the industry a proper latitude in the construction
of magazines, it is held that vehicles used for transporting and for storing
explosive materials that are constructed in conformity with the standards
listed below, and in compliance with all other safety and security provisions
contained in Part 55 (e.g., effectively immobilized when unattended) will
meet the requirements of ATF regulations. Even though constructed on the
same vehicle, each compartment will be considered as a separate magazine.
The two magazines on the vehicle will, however, be considered as one magazine
when applying the American Table of Distances [see Table at &#167; 55.218].
<P>
<B>Construction Standards For Storage of Electric Blasting Caps(Non
Mass-Detonating) </B>
<DL>
  <DT>
    a. The container or compartment must provide for total enclosure of the electric
    blasting caps. <BR>
    b. The partition between the explosives storage compartment and the electric
    blasting cap compartment must be of laminate construction consisting of A/C
    grade or better exterior plywood, gypsum board [sheetrock] and low carbon
    steel plates. In order of arrangement, the laminate must conform to the
    following, with minimum thickness of each lamination as indicated:
