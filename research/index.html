This category, like other INFOcentral categories, is dedicated to answering
questions and providing useful information about a specific topic, in this
case Research Rocketry.
A "research" rocket motor, as defined by Tripoli Rocketry Association,
is "any motor which has not been certified by Tripoli
Motor Testing and/or NAR for use by Tripoli members"
(<a href="http://www.tripoli.org/Documents/TRA_exp_rules.html">www.tripoli.org/Documents/TRA_exp_rules.html</a>).
Following these guidelines, the various segments of this category will cover some of the
references available, common propellant types, safety, composition, and
propellant testing.


This topic is also called "amateur" and "experimental" rocketry, but we emphasize
the research aspect here since commercial motors are cheaper and more reliable for
propelling your rockets.
(See the <a href="propulsion.html">PROPULSION</a> area for more information
on motors.)
