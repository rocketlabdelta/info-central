A single use motor is designed to be used once and discarded.
These motors usually use a wound paper or plastic case in the lower impulse classes, where the higher impulse classes are made of plastic, phenolic or even aluminum cased.

Single use high power motors usually cost significantly more than the equivalent reload for a reloadable motor.
Reloadable motors are usually used rather than single use motors.
