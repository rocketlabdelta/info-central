## Introduction

Want to try something different from the standard ammonium perchlorate (solid fuel) motors?
Hybrids offer some nice advantages over solid fuel motors:

- easy to set up (just screw the fuel grain into the motor)
- non-explsive (no LEUP required to store or use)
- no ignitors to fool with (requires separate launch hardware)
- inexpensive (a Hypertek J reload costs about $20)
- no messy clean-up

The motors fit into standard 54mm motor mount tubes.
However, there is no delay-based ejection charge with hybrids so an altimeter or other recovery system system must be used.

Hybrid motors are currently made by Hypertek and [Aerotech](http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com/).
Aerotech has a nice [page](http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com/products/motors/about_Hybrid.html) on hybrids.
They even have [Assembly and Operation Instructions](http://www.aerotech-rocketry.com/products/motors/54mmInst/54mmJ280HW_inst.html) on-line.
See below for information on Hypertek products.

## Hypertek

The above pciture shows the components of the Hypertek flight motor, consisting of only three major parts: the oxidizer tank, the injector end bell, and the combined furle grain/combustion chamber (called the “monolithic fuel grain”).

Two years after Hypertek flew the world’s first N2O Hybrid rocket and following one year of BetaTesting, Tripoli Motor Testing has approved Hypertek hybrids for consumer use in High Power Rocketry.
The Hypertek hybrid motor was developed as a high tech, low cost alternative to the ancient technology of solid propellant rocket motors.
Hybrid motors have several safety advantages over solids.
The fuel and oxidizer are isolated from each other until just before ignition, thus eliminating the requirement for a low explosive permit during transportation and storage of rocket motors.
The Hypertek System also uses a remote fill/fire launch system that gives NASA style launch realism as well as a 100% pyrotechnic free ignition.

The Hypertek fueler/launcher shown above will work with most popular launch stands using 3/8 to 1/2 inch launch rods and handles rockets from 1-1/8 inches to 6 inches in diameter.

The Hypertek flight motor consists of three major parts: the oxidizer tank, the injector bell, and the fuel grain.
The fuel grain is molded from thermoplastic and has an insert-molded phenolic nozzle.
This monolithic grain functions as both the fuel and the combustion chamber.
We’ve eliminated the complicated assembly of a reloadable system by incorporating the fuel, nozzle and motor case into one injection molded component.
The fuel grain simply screws onto the injector bell prior to flight and the spent fuel grain is unscrewed and disposed of after each flight.
No messy, time consuming clean up operations are required.
Typical motor turn around times between flights can be less than 5 minutes.
The injector bell has field interchangeable injector orifices for varying the thrust levels to tailor your motor to the needs of your rocket or launch field.
There are currently five different orifices available and more on the way.
