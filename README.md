# [INFOcentral][1]

info-central.com was a repository of Hobby Rocketry knowledge from 1996-2009.
It was revived by [Rocket Lab Delta][2] in 2020.

A lot of the original content has held up well.
However, there are some areas--like Electronics and Regulations--where things have changed significantly.

A knowledge base like this is an open, community effort.
See [CONTRIBUTING][3] for how to get involved.
