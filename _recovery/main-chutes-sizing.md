The formulas provided below will calculate an estimated parachute size that will result in a descent rate of about 15 feet per second.
If the landing area is hard, such as packed earth or salt, a slower descent rate may be desired to prevent damage to the rocket.

## Circular Parachute

\\[D = 39.6 \times \sqrt{W \times 0.454}\\]

Where:  
\\(D\\) is the diameter of the parachute in inches  
\\(W\\) is the weight of the rocket in pounds

### Example of a 5 pound rocket:

\\[39.6 \times \sqrt{ 5 \times 0.454} = 59.7\\]

Round up to a 60” circular parachute

## X-Form Parachute

\\[S = 51.5 \times \sqrt{W \times 0.454}\\]

Where:  
\\(S\\) is the size of the parachute in inches  
\\(W\\) is the weight of the rocket in pounds

### Example of a 5 pound rocket:

\\[51.5 \times \sqrt{ 5 \times 0.454} = 77.6\\]

Round up to a 78” X-form parachute

A smaller parachute will result in a faster descent.
A larger one a slower descent.
If the ground is soft, such as grass covered, you may want to use a smaller parachute for a faster descent.
A faster descent will result in less drift.
If the ground is hard, like frozen earth or salt, you may want a slower descent, and therefore a larger parachute.
