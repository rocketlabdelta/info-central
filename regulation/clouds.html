FAA regulations prohibit flying into clouds. Before you fly you
need to know the cloud deck. Many airports have automated
aviation weather reporting available through a telephone.
You call the number and you hear an automated report. Take your
wireless telephone to the field.

You can find an ASOS (Automated Surface Observing System)
telephone number by finding the airport closest to the launch
field with an ASOS facility through this web site:
<a href="http://www.airnav.com/airports/search.html">
http://www.airnav.com/airports/search.html</a> .

Specify the area that you are interested in. If you want
to use longitude and latitude you can get that data
through <a href="http://www.mapsonus.com">www.mapsonus.com</a>
and other web mapping services.

Select an airport from the list of airports close to the
flying field, and look through the data for "ASOS".
If it doesn't exist then select another airport. If a
telephone number is provided then that number provides
automated reports. For example:

WX ASOS: PHONE 414-769-7161


That's the number for Milwaukee, WI. The weather report will include data like this:

  Broken 4400      which means     Broken clouds at 4400'
Scattered 6000   which means     Scattered clouds at 6000'


The sky can have multiple cloud decks.

You can also get a weather report through
