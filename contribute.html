 Prizes!


In the hope of stimulating more contributions to INFOcentral, we offer periodic prizes.
The next prize will be a $200 gift certificate at Magnum.
A drawing will be held at the end of November 2001 from all the articles published
Just in time for Christmas!

On September 20, 1999 Bill Kirby won his choice of a Dynacom Black Widow
kit or a set of AeroTech 54mm hardware (Dr. Rocket RMS 54/852-1706 System).
Bill chose the 54mm set which you can see in the picture on the left
(click on it for a larger picture).
Each prize is worth almost $200!

On February 21, 2000 Dean Roth won his choice of a Dynacom Black Widow kit
or a $200 gift certificate at Magnum.
He chose the gift certificate and bought a large case and several reloads.
Dean is the champion contributor with 24 articles to his credit.  Way to go Dean!



Keep those contributions coming as we will definitely have another raffle in the future.




FINE PRINT:
These prizes are run like raffles: each article published in INFOcentral will earn the
author a "raffle ticket" (this includes articles published before the raffle starts).
A few days after the ending date, a ticket will be randomly chosen and that ticket holder will
choose their prize from the offerings for that raffle.
Due to the uncertainty of delivery time from some manufacturers (such as Dynacom),
we cannot guarantee a delivery date.
However, the prizes will be purchased and shipped as quickly as possible after
the raffle ends.
