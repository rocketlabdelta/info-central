There are a nice set of on-line calculators available on the Washington High Power site. These calculators use VBScript, and so only work with Mirosoft’s Internet Explorer.

[Descent Rate](http://www.washingtonhighpower.com/Descent%20Rate.htm)[‘Chute Calc](http://www.washingtonhighpower.com/Chute%20Calculator.htm)[Drift Calc](http://www.washingtonhighpower.com/drift_calculator.htm)[Black Powder](http://www.washingtonhighpower.com/black_powder_calculator.htm)

I also have received a few suggestions for a stand-alone version of the calculators (not online). I have finished making a desktop version and it now posted to my web site for download:

[www.rockethead.net/Downloads/RocketryTools.zip](http://www.rockethead.net/Downloads/RocketryTools.zip)

It is freeware and I do not ask for or expect any payment from those who download it. It is a standard .zip file, to install the program you would need to unzip and then run setup.exe.
