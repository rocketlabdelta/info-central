Rockets that use electronics, such as an altimeter or timer, to deploy
the
recovery system need igniters to ignite the black powder ejection
charge.
Desired characteristics of an ejection charge igniter are listed below.

 <ol>
	<li>Require low current to fire so that it can be used with common
		rocketry electronics. Most motor igniters require far more
		current than rocketry electronics can deliver to an igniter.
	</li><li>A short burn with little flame - long enough to ignite the
ejection charge
		but not too long to ignite the recovery system or airframe.
	</li><li>Reliable
</li></ol>



Most rocket motor igniters are high current igniters, and will not work
with
most rocketry electronics. Motor igniters are designed to produce a
large fireball
for a long period of time (1/2 - 1 second), which is not desireable
inside a rocket's
airframe.
Igniters acceptable as ejection charge ignition are listed below.
(Electrical igniters are also sometimes called electric matches.)



 <ul>
	<li>Daveyfire SA2000 N28B
	</li><li>Daveyfire SA2000 N28BR
	</li><li>Oxral
	</li><li>Atlas
	</li><li>HiRMI
</li></ul>


The list may not include all available low current igniters.
Manufacturers come
and go, and models change.

The list does not include photographic flashbulbs. The author does not
believe
that flashbulbs are acceptable as ejection charge igniters due to
questions
of reliability and accidental firing.


Daveyfire Inc.


Daveyfire is a company that manufactures igniters for consumer products
like
automobile airbags, the blasting industry and the military. They are
also used
by the fireworks display industry. The igniters are very reliable.
(Note: Daveyfire
is a specific company, not a generic term for "electronic matches" or
ejection charge
igniters. Some rocketry supply vendors incorrectly sell other brands of
igniters
as "Daveyfires.")

Daveyfire products suitable for ejection charge igniters are models
SA2000 N28B,
SA2000 N28BR and SA2000 N28F. The N28B is most commonly used. The N28BR
model
is the same as the N28B except that it has 3 times the pyrogen. The
N28F burns
about 20 times longer than the N28B, but the burn time is still brief.
Details are listed below.

Some rocketry supply vendors sell Daveyfire igniters in small
quantities.
They can also be purchased in bulk only (usually a minimum order of one
box
of 100 igniters) from the company listed below.

Recommendations

Safety is important. Massive rockets can inflict significant personal
injury, including death, and create major property damage when the
recovery system
fails. One failure mode is a defective ejection charge igniter.
Although the
failure rate of commercially manufactured igniters used to ignite
ejection
charges is low, a redundant igniter can be a good idea. Rocketry
altimeters and
timers can fire two low current igniters per charge. The author
believes that it is
a better idea to spend an extra $2 to $3 on extra igniters than to
watch a rocket
nose into the ground, a car or person.
