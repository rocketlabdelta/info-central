Assumptions have been made for some factors (air temperature, pressure,
etc.) to create a simple equation which should work for most
HPR situations (flights up to about 1 mile, air temperature about
70 degrees F). When actual conditions are significantly different,
such as 100 degree temperature or an altitude of 5 miles,
then one may need to perform more complex calculations.
 
In some cases a drogue is not needed. When an airframe
will fall horizontally then drag may slow the rocket enough that a
drogue is not needed. This can often be the case when an airframe is
split into two approximately equal parts. For example the author has
a 5 pound rocket that falls at about 45 feet/second in a flat spin
when the fin canister and payload sections are separated at apogee.
In this case a drogue is not needed. A small one (12" or 18") may
be used to produce a more stable descent, so that the fin canister
and payload sections don't bang into each other.
  
Some rocket designs don't allow the airframe to be used to slow a
rocket's descent. In these cases a drogue is needed. For example,
rockets whose airframe cannot be split, or those that deploy the drogue
and main parachutes from the same location.
  
A drogue's purpose is to slow a rocket's descent, but still allow it
to descend rapidly enough to avoid significant drift. Descent needs
to be quick, but not too quick that the rocket and/or main parachute
will be torn apart when the main parachute is deployed. The author
aims for a descent rate of about 50 feet/second.
  
It's useful to know how fast a rocket will descend without a parachute
under different conditions. For example, a 4" diameter, 5 pound rocket
will come in nose first at about 253 feet/second (172 miles/hour).
The equation for calculating terminal velocity is shown below.
  
 
   Vt  = sqrt( 2W/(Cd * rho * A)) 

   Vt= terminal velocity in feet/second
   W= weight in pounds
   Cd= drag coefficient - assume 0.75
   rho= atmospheric density (about 0.0024 at sea level)
   A= surface area in square feet
 
 
If a 4" diameter, 5 pound rocket comes in nose first then:
 
    A = 3.1415 * 2^2 / 144 = 0.087 ft^2 

    Vt = sqrt( (2 * 5) / (0.75 * 0.0024 * 0.087)) = 253 feet/sec
 
 
If the same rocket has a 60" long airframe and falls horizontally, then:
  
 
    A = pi * r * l = 3.1415 * 2 * 60 = 377 in^2 = 2.6 ft^2 

    Vt = sqrt( (2 * 5) / (0.75 * 0.0024 * 2.6)) = 46 feet/second
 
 
If a rocket will fall at a reasonable rate without a drogue, then
one is not needed unless you want a small (12"-18") one to add stability
without significantly affecting the descent rate. If a drogue is needed
then the terminal velocity equation can be rearranged to calculate the
desired size of a circular parachute.
The simplified equation is shown below, and assumes a desired
descent rate of 50 feet/second.
  
 
   D = 24 * sqrt( 0.14 * W ) 

   D = drogue diameter in inches
   W = weight in pounds without propellant
 
 
Example of a 5 pound rocket: D = 24 * sqrt( 0.14 * 5 ) = 20 (or 24) inches
