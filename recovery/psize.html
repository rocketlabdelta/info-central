The formulas provided below will calculate an estimated parachute size that will result in a descent rate of about 15 feet per second. If the landing area is hard, such as packed earth or salt, a slower descent rate
may be desired to prevent damage to the rocket.


Circular Parachute

 size in inches = sqrt( rocket_weight_in_pounds * 0.454 ) * 39.6

Example of a 5 pound rocket:

 sqrt( 5 * 0.454 ) * 39.6 = 59.7" (60" parachute)

X-Form Parachute

 size in inches = sqrt( rocket_weight_in_pounds * 0.454 ) * 51.5

Example of a 5 pound rocket:

 sqrt( 5 * 0.454 ) * 51.5 = 77.6" (78" parachute)

A smaller parachute will result in a faster descent. A larger one a slower descent. If the ground is soft, such as grass covered, you may want to use a smaller parachute for a faster descent. A faster descent will result in less drift. If the ground is hard, like frozen earth or salt, you may want a slower descent, and therefore a larger parachute.
