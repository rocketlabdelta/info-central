Here is a spreadsheet that I created to use in conjunction with Terry
McCreary's Propel20 worksheet or similar Kn chart.  The Aerotech Medusa
Nozzle creates a problem when you try to compute Kn because the Kn chart
gives results based on a single nozzle diameter.  The Medusa nozzle has
more than one nozzle and you can't simply add them together.  This
spreadsheet converts each diameter to area, then adds the areas of all the
nozzles and computes a corresponding single diameter for that value.  This
"diameter" is used in the Propel20 spreadsheet to compute Kn for your
medusa nozzle.  I've also included a chart with fraction to decimal
conversions for sizing drill bits.
