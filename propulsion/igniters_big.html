An Igniter for Large Motors


Motors with a large core can present an ignition problem. A large motor can
have a core diameter of 3/4 to 1 inch. A plain electric igniter, like a
Firestar, Fire in the Hole, Magnelite, etc., can look very small and lonely
in a 1" diameter core. A regular electric igniter can serve as the basis for an
enhanced, multiple stage igniter that you can construct for motors with large
diameter cores and hard to ignite propellants.

Multiple types of motor igniters can be created. Only one type
is presented here. This technique can be modified to accomodate
other ignition materials and technologies.
Additional techniques, such as dangling lengths
of Thermalite down the core, can be employed to
enhance motor ignition, which can be critical when igniting
multiple stages.



Materials

<img src="/images/ig1.jpg">
 <ul>
        <li>An electric igniter such as a Firestar, Fire in the Hole,
            Magnelite or Daveyfire N28F. (The Daveyfire N28F can be enhanced
	with a dip into a pyrogen like Firestar or Magnelite pyrogen.)

	Two electric igniters can be used, if desired, to ensure that a return
	trip to the rocket to replace a defective electrical igniter is not needed.

         </li><li>A grain of AeroTech Blue Thunder propellant.
 You can get a grain
by buying a small Aerotech reload kit such as an F52 or H238.
 	    Keep the propellant grain
            and dispose of the other components in the kit.

         </li><li>Carpet thread (strong thread)

         </li><li>1/8" dowel

         </li><li>A knife</li></ul>

Directions

 <ol>
<img src="/images/ig2.jpg">
        <li>Slice four slivers from the AeroTech Blue Thunder
                propellant slug. The slivers shown here are about 2" long
		and are from a 29mm slug.


        <img src="/images/ig3.jpg">
         </li><li>Position the propellant slivers around the igniter's pyrogen and wrap            the thread around them to secure them to the igniter.            Tie the thread.		 	Another group of slivers can be attached below the first group 	if desired. The fireball from the first group will ignite the second.

	<img src="/images/ig4.jpg">
	 </li><li>Attach the igniter to a thin wood dowel (1/8").
         This can be done by winding the
	the igniter along the dowel and fastening with masking tape.
         The dowel keeps the igniter from falling out of the motor.
        Cut the dowel so that it sits on the ground or blast plate to hold the igniter
        in the top of the motor.

		the core of a motor.)
