Staging composite propellant motors is more complex than staging black
powder
motors. Composite motors are more difficult to ignite, and do not reach
operating pressure immediately. Several factors must be considered.


Timing Sustainer Ignition

Examine the thrust curve of the booster's motor and run flight
simulations through a
computer program to determine the best time to ignite the sustainer's
motor.
The best time depends in part upon your motor choices.
Different motors have different thrust curves. Some produce significant
thrust until burnout. Some have a rapid decrease in thrust after
ignition
and may not produce a significant amount of thrust during the final
part of the burn.

Assume a two stage rocket where the booster motor burns for 2.5
seconds,
and its thrust curve shows a significant decrease in thrust
after 2 seconds. If staging is performed after booster motor burnout
(after 2.5 seconds),
the rocket may coast for about 1 second before the sustainer's motor
ignite.
Add the 1/2 second of insignificant thrust, and during the 1.5 second
coast
the rocket may slow and arc away from the desired flight path by the
time the
sustainer's motor reaches operating pressure. For this example,
sustainer ignition
may best be initiated about 1 to 1.5 seconds after booster motor
ignition,
which will allow the sustainer's motor to reach operating pressure at
about the
time the booster's motor's thrust will become insignificant. This could
be
accomplished by using a timer that detects launch and starts its
countdown
when the rocket launches.



Composite propellant motors can take one second to reach operating
pressure
after ignition. This delay must be taken into account when determining
the optimum
ignition time. If we assume a one second delay between ignition and
full operating
pressure in the example given above, the best time to ignite the second
stage's
motor may be one second after booster ignition. In this particular case
the
second stage motor will reach operating pressure at about the time the
booster's
thrust become insignificant.



One problem with igniting a sustainer's motor prior to booster and
sustainer
separation is damage due to the sustainer's motor's blast hitting the
booster.
This problem can be lessened or prevented by using materials in the
booster that will
survive the blast from the sustainer's motor, or to separate the
booster and
sustainer before the sustainer's motor ignites.

If the booster and sustainer are separated before the sustainer reaches
operating
pressure it will coast for a time.
The sustainer's motor needs to quickly reach operating pressure before
the rocket
slows and turns away from the desired flight path toward the ground.



If the booster and sustainer are to be separated prior to ignition of
the
sustainer's motor (the sustainer will coast for a short time), then
separation
can by placing a small black powder charge in the coupler, and wiring
it's igniter
in parallel with the sustainer's igniter.


Sustainer Ignition


Electronics, like a timer that detects launch, usually through a
G-switch,
or an accelerometer, are often used to initiate
ignition of a sustainer's motor, along with a low current igniter. Most
low
current igniters will not ignite a composite propellant motor alone. A
low
current igniter like a Daveyfire N28F can form the basis for a multiple
stage
igniter.



Most rocketry electronics (timers and accelerometers), will not fire
medium and
high current igniters. Some devices are designed to dump sufficient
current to
work with medium and high current igniters. However, those devices
often require
additional batteries which adds weight.



A medium current igniter like a Fire in the Hole (Trailing Edge
Technologies)
with a tungsten bridgewire can be used with a device like a timer
that can dump a lot of current. A couple of high current timers
designed for rocketry
are available. No recommendations are made here because manufacturers
and product
lines change.



The right ignition tool depends upon what motor is used in the
sustainer.
Some propellants are easier to ignite than others. Some motors have a
large
diameter core while others have a small diameter core.



A motor with a large diameter core may need a
multiple stage igniter. This type of ignitier utilizing a low current
electrical igniter like a Daveyfire N28F is described elsewhere in
INFOcentral.
Briefly, one or two N28F igniters are dipped into an additional pyrogen
like
Firestar or Magnelite pyrogen. Then slivers of AeroTech Blue Thunder
propellant
are attached to the igniter. The N28F igniters the additional pyrogen,
which
ignites the Blue Thunder slivers, which creates a fireball in the motor
that
ignites the motor's propellant. For a greater probability of success,
use two
electrical igniters if the core is large enough.



For smaller core motors place some AeroTech Blue Thunder shaving (thin,
small pieces
of the propellant) ahead of and around the electrical igniter. Small
pieces of propellant
ignite faster than large pieces. A paper (or masking tape) "cup" can be
placed
on the electrical
igniter below the pyrogen to keep the shavings from falling out of the
motor.
The cup must be paper so that it will disintegrate upon motor ignition
and not block
the path to the nozzle. (A blocked nozzle can cause a motor to
overpressurize
and burst.) The igniter may need to be assembled into the motor as the
motor is assembled.


Keeping the Igniter Where it Belongs


The sustainer's igniter must be retained in the motor and at the top of
the
motor until it fires.
This can be a problem for large motors and large igniters. The G forces
during boost may cause the igniter to fall out of the motor, or to
collapse to the
bottom of the motor. Both situations can result in failed ignition or a
failed
flight if the motor is ignited at the bottom.



An igniter for a motor with a small diameter core will usually have
wires
stiff enough to keep the igniter positioned in the motor. However, a
long
igniter for a long motor like an AeroTech J570 may collapse under its
weight.
The igniter can be secured into the motor during motor assembly with
string
or string (carpet) thread. The string/thread will burn at motor
ignition
allowing the igniter to be expelled from the motor.



Igniters for large motors can have enough mass to compress the wire
leads during boost,
which can cause the igniter to fall out of the motor or fall to the
bottom of
the motor. If the wire leads get compressed at the nozzle the nozzle
could get
blocked, and if the motor ignites it may burst due to
overpressurization.



An igniter can be secured in a reusable motor with string or carpet
thread during motor
assembly. Tie the string/thread to the igniter below the pyrogen and
secure it
between the top propellant slug and the top of the motor. (Between the
top propellant
grain and the forward insulator for AeroTech motors.) This will hold
the
igniter in the top of the motor. Upon ignition the string/thread will
burn so that
the igniter wires can exit the motor. Thermalite, if available, can be
used
in place of string/thread, and will assist with motor ignition.



Another method to keep an igniter positioned in a sustainer's motor
during boost,
provided the nozzle diameter and motor core are large enough, is to
attach the igniter to a thin (1/8") wood dowel. Rest the dowel against
the
booster in the interstage coupler. If ignition will occur during a
coast after
the stages have separated then use masking tape to hold the igniter
in the sustainer during the coast phase.
The dowel must be free to exit the motor when the motor ignites.
