Too often, AeroTech reload kits are packed with an incorrect nozzle. Using the reload with the wrong nozzle can cause it to under perform or even to CATO. Before you build that next AeroTech reload, check to make sure the right nozzle is packed in the kit. Measure the diameter of the nozzle and compare it to that listed in the table.
