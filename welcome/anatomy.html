The picture below is from the Handbook of Model Rocketry by G. Harry Stine,

One interesting thing is that as large and as complex as rockets get, they're
still just variations on this basic design.
There are fundamental physical principles which restrict what a stable and
efficient rocket will be like.
Of course, details of design and selection of materials differ widely, but most
rockets really are "rocket shaped" and made up of these basic pieces.
