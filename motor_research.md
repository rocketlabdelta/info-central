This category, like other INFOcentral categories, is dedicated to answering questions and providing useful information about a specific topic, in this case Research Rocketry.
A “research” rocket motor, as defined by Tripoli Rocketry Association, is “any motor which has not been certified by Tripoli Motor Testing and/or NAR for use by Tripoli members”.
See the [Tripoli Research Safety Code][1] for more information.
Following these guidelines, the various segments of this category will cover some of the references available, common propellant types, safety, composition, and propellant testing.

This topic is also called “amateur” and “experimental” rocketry, but we emphasize the research aspect here since commercial motors are cheaper and more reliable for propelling your rockets. 
(See the [PROPULSION area][2] for more information on motors.)
