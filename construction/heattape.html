 Vacuum bagging is sometimes used to produce the strongest and
lightest composite laminates. The pressure induced by the vacuum
bag squeezes out excess epoxy, and compresses the fabric weave
tightly against the base form or tube. A side benefit is the
substantial improvement in surface flatness and texture for
better cosmetic appearance. Composite fabrics can be vacuum
bagged to the outside and even the inside of rocketry airframe tubes.
If you haven't done so already, read the
articles on Vacuum Bagging and Reinforcing Tubes
here for two excellent treatments of the subject.

 But sometimes, vacuum bagging is just too much of a pain in
the neck for a quick little project. Following is a discussion of
the use of Heat Shrink Tape from <a href="http://www.acp-composites.com">Aerospace Composite Products</a>
to reproduce some of the benefits of vacuum bagging without the
vacuum pump, compressor, bag, and endless waiting.

 One inch wide Heat Shrink Tape from ACP costs $15 for 100
yards. Seven yards were used to wrap this project's tube. You'll also
need fiberglass, epoxy, a release fabric like Peel Ply, and
'breather fabric' to absorb the excess epoxy. Many rocketeers use
2 to 6 ounce per yard 'glass, and tight weave 'glass looks
better. Laminating under pressure lets you get away with a
heavier and coarser weave fabric. A very slow, thin epoxy like
West Systems 206 is necessary to allow the excess to squeeze out.
West Systems nylon Peel Ply release fabric is good, but ACP's
teflon coated 'glass (at $6 per yard) is the most porous release
fabric. West Systems, ACP, <a href="http://www.fibreglast.com">Fibreglast</a>
and others sell composite, release, and breather fabrics.

 You start by gathering all the tools for the job and cutting
out the three fabrics. The fiberglass and breather fabrics should
overlap the tube ends by at least an inch or two, and should
overlap themselves by about one inch or so. Release fabric must
overlap the 'glass by a few inches. Even a small tube like this
will still need two or three squirts of West epoxy, because the
roller and breather will absorb some. Roughen the tube, mix the
epoxy, and brush or roll a wet coat on the tube.

 Use your best lay up techniques to apply the 'glass, and wrap
it smoothly, evenly, and tightly around the tube. You won't be
able to see the layup once you cover it with release and
breather. Work a wet coat of epoxy into the 'glass- the release
fabric and breather will absorb the excess.

 &nbsp;

 Apply the release fabric ("peel ply") like it was
another layer of 'glass: smoothly and tightly. You may want to
rub it in gently with your gloved hands. It will determine the
final surface of the layup. Don't disturb the 'glass underneath-
it's mighty easy to do.

 It's time for the fluffy breather element. In vacuum bagging,
the breather element functions to establish a pathway for the
vacuum to evacuate all areas of the bag. In this application,
we're using it to soak up excess resin. A wrinkle or two in the
breather element probably won't hurt the surface characteristics
of your layup. A few strips of masking tape will keep it tightly
in place for the next step.

 Start wrapping the heat shrink tape by wrapping it three or
four times around itself to "lock it in".

 Heat Shrink Tape doesn't Heat Shrink very much. You must wrap
it fairly tightly. Overlap each wrap at least a quarter of an
inch. The more overlap, the more "shrinking power" you
get.

 Wrapped and ready to cook. This tape shrinks at less than 175
degrees. When working on a small part, wrap it loosely in
aluminum foil (just for cleanliness) and toss it in the oven.
A typical oven measures to be 145 degrees at its lowest setting.
The heat of the epoxy's exotherm in the 145 degree oven is enough to shrink the tape.
On a sunny day, the wrapped tube can be put under a black barbecue grill
cover on the back porch.
Just be sure to shield the epoxy from the direct UV rays of the Sun,
which is bad for it.

 Finished. There are no bubbles or wrinkles, and the only
surface texture is what's left from the Peel Ply. The seam is so
tight that you can't see it in the photo. The cloth fibers are
compressed nicely onto the tube. One doesn't get results this good
without vacuum bagging, or otherwise pressure laminating.
