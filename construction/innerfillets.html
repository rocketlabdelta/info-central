I know that there are a few methods for the difficult
and sometimes long process of getting good strong fillets
for fin to motor mount and inside the airframe without using
glass carbon fiber etc.  Some people use a dowel while
others pour the epoxy from the aft end and tilt the rocket
which allows the epoxy to run down the joint.  I on the
other hand have found another way that some of you may find
unique and even easier.


The materials you will need other than the obvious will
be (2) 20 cc catheter syringes, a piece of automotive vacuum
hose (length will depend) and, Epoxy thinner.  Make sure the
hose fits tightly over the small end of the syringe.  Cut
the hose so it will reach the forward end of the fin but
don't connect it to the syringe yet.  You can get the
syringes at any medical supply facility.  I also prefer to
use 30 minute epoxy.


First, tac all the fins to the motor mount by which ever
means one may be accustom to.  I like using CA myself.  Next
mix the appropriate amount of epoxy to do one side of two
fins.  Suck or pour the epoxy into the syringe.  If you
choose to pour the epoxy in then you will have to plug the
end with your finger so the epoxy won't run out and make a
mess.  After that you will have to insert the plunger part
way in and turn the syringe upside down allowing the epoxy
to run towards the plunger and then squeeze the plunger
forward to get the air space out.  Now connect the piece of
hose you cut to the end of the syringe.  With the rocket
laying flat,  insert the hose  to the forward end of the fin
and dispense the epoxy while pulling back to the aft end.
Take your time to ensure that you get the desired amount of
epoxy on the joint.  That's it.  Let it sit and set up
before you do the next set.  At this time you can wipe of
any epoxy that may have gotten on the aft end of the
airframe.  But if you did it right and took your time you
don't have to worry about that.  Clean the hose and syringe
buy flushing the epoxy thinner through.  Do this several
times to make sure its clean and reuse it for the rest of
the fins.
