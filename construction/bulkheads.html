To make my own bulkheads and centering rings,
I use 1/4" plywood for stock and used a bandsaw to cut the rough circles.

After the blanks were cut, I drilled a ¼" diameter hole in the center and
put a ¼" bolt thorough them. Then I placed the bolt in the drill press and
use a grinder to make them perfectly circular and more importantly, the
correct size to fit into the couplers. One piece, which is
actually flooring laminate, I ground the O.D. to match the O.D. of the
coupler for the avionics bay on my project.  For the anti-zipper coupler, I
installed a 7/8" diameter forstner bit into the drill press and cut 3 holes
in each bulkhead.

Here is some of the finished bulkheads and the small section of 3.9" tube
for the avionics bay.  I was able to use a miter saw to cut the 1" wide
piece - a very clean, straight cut.

To convert the bulkheads into centering rings, you need a fly cutter on the
drill press.  I used some small brads (3 of them) to secure the bulkhead to
a piece of base material.  Once you have adjusted the fly cutter to the
correct diameter, you can clamp the board with the bulkhead attached under
the drill press.  Just align the hole in the bulkhead with the bit on the
fly cutter and carefully cut the center out.  I made 3.9" x 54mm centering
rings with this method.
