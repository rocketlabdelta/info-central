A rocket needs to be able to accomodate motors of different lengths. Therefore a motor block in the motor mount tube is not used to keep the motor from moving up through the rocket.  Most reloadable motors are manufactured with a lip on the aft (nozzle) closure as a thrust ring to prevent the motor from moving up through the rocket. However, motor and rocket kit manufacturers usually do not provide a means to keep the motor from falling out after burnout.
 
Several options are available. Some must be added during contruction. Some can be added after a rocket has been finished.
  
Examples 
<img src="images/propulsion_tnut.jpg"> 
A common practice is to install a #6 T-nut (also called a blind nut) into the aft centering ring. A hole is drilled into the ring for the barrel of the T-nut. The pointed anchors can be flatted because most centering rings are too thin to use them. A little epoxy around the edge of the T-nut will hold it in place. A screw can
then be used to keep the motor in the motor mount tube.
 
  
<img src="images/propulsion_tnut2.jpg">
You can see the barrels of two T-nuts protruding through the centering ring in this picture. The flat part goes behind the centering ring.
 
  
<img src="images/propulsion_panel.jpg">
This example uses a "panel clip". The clip is held in place by a screw into the T-nut installed in the centering ring. A panel clip is used on screen doors, and can be found in hardware stores in the section with screen door repair parts. The slot in the clip is part of the clip.
 
  
<img src="images/propulsion_washer.jpg">
A simple washer can be used with a screw screwed into a T-nut installed in the centering ring.
 
  
<img src="images/propulsion_wire.jpg">
A retainer made from wire works with single use motors.
 
  
<img src="images/propulsion_cluster.jpg">
  A screw and nut are used to retain this cluster. The screw is epoxied into the rocket. The nut unscrews to release the motors.
 
  
T-nuts cannot be added to an already constructed rocket. However, expansion bolts and other devices available in any hardware store can be also be used to add positive motor retention to an assembled rocket. Some companies have screw-on retainers that can be added to existing rockets.
