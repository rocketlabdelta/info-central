Here is a jig used to create half scale fins for a Nike booster.
These fins are roughly 1 inch thick at the root and ½ inch at the tip.
The jig, used with a router, cuts the taper and bevel perfectly,
(no sanding) and is very easy to make.

  
First cut 4 pieces of ¾" MDF about 12" x 24".  Locate the center and
drill a ¼" hole in 2 of the pieces.

  
Take one piece with the hole and one of the other ones and lay them on top
of each other.  Install a length of piano hinge along the long side of the 2
pieces, do the same with the other 2 also.

  
Counter bore one of the holes on the inside so a bolt can be inserted and
the pieces can still close.

  
Insert the bolt from the first table assembly into the second table assembly
and Presto!  A compound table for milling operations.

  
To use you need a set of rails to run your router on.  I cut two pieces of
MDF about 3" x 36" and two pieces about 6" x 36".  Butt joint them to form an
L.  I have an old solid core door that I use for a bench that I screwed the
rails to along each edge.  Position the tables between the rails and the jig
is complete.

  
Attach the router to another piece of MDF to run across the top of the rails.

With the tables positioned at 90 degrees to each other, the fin material is
attached using double sided carpet tape.  Shims are inserted into one of the
tables to create the taper.  Once all 4 fins are tapered the other table is
raised to cut the bevel.  Cut one edge then rotate the tables 180 degrees
to cut the other edge.  The sweep of the leading and trailing edges will
automatically be cut by the router when you complete the other side.  So you
can just start out with a square block of wood.  (mine are a combination of
½" Baltic Birch plywood and Styrofoam to save weight)

  
Fiberglass the completed side of the fin and reinstall it in the jig.  This
time you will need to readjust the table angle for the taper to twice the
original angle.  Taper all of the fins then begin the beveling process, this
is where the sweep angle is automatically cut.

  
Two problems encountered when cutting the second side were that the tape
did not want to stick to the raw fiberglass very well and the leading and
trailing edges tended to flutter under the router bit as all that was necessary was two
layers of 6 oz cloth on the foam in that area.  A simple solution to both
problems would be to stick the fins to another board, such as ¼ inch
plywood or Masonite and pack some Bondo under the fins in the area where the
leading edges and trailing edges will be cut.  This will act as a temporary
adhesive and will stiffen up the edges while cutting them.  The Bondo can be
chipped off and the remainder easily sands off.
