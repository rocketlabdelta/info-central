Model and high power rocketry have used numerous construction components over the years, from regular cardboard tubes, hardened cardboard tubes inpregnated with phenolic resins, to a variety of fiberglass components.  A few recent manufacturers have branched into wooden tubes or angular airframes built of wood pieces.


While most kit manufacturers has stuck with these three alternatives, scratch builders have used anything available to build rockets, including PVC tubing, cardboard and other similar components.


History
Early model rockets built by industry pioneers consisted mainly of cardboard tubing and lightweight woods, usually balsa or basswood. Later, high performance models utilized high quality aircraft plywood, phenolic impregnated tubing and fiberglass sheeting.  Today, fiberglass airframes and other high tech components are considered standard fare in the world of high powered model rocketry.
