The Electon Beam® is the current incarnation of the basic Estes launch controller (previously under the name “Solar”). This is a nice little controller which runs off four AA batteries in the unit itself so it is convenient and self-contained. The flip side of this is that it isn’t capable of firing non-Estes ignitors. The information below was taken from the Estes 1996 catalog.
