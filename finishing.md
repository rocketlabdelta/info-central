Everyone has different desires for the finish of their rocket. Some are happy to stop when construction is finished and fly the rocket as is. Others want that perfect scale model paint job.

Whether you quickly use a single color paint from a spray can or take pains to apply a complex finish, this section will give you pointers others have discovered to make it easier and come out looking better.
