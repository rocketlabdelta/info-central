Advances in electronics technology have created many opportunities for new ideas in consumer rocketry.  Electronic ignition of upper stages of multi-staged rockets is now common as is the use of radio controlled devices.  Several altimeters are available including some with downloadable memory modules.  Electronic deployment of recovery devices, as well as deployment based on altitude, is now practical.

In this section, we will cover each of the individual areas of interest, including but not limited to:
 <ul>
<li>Altimeters
</li><li>Accelerometers
</li><li>On-board Computers
</li><li>Data Aquisition
</li><li>Timers
</li><li>Remote Control
</li><li>Photographic Payloads
</li></ul>
With this area of interest such a hot topic, many changes will occur even as this is being written.  Electronic payloads are an exciting and fun part of the hobby, and make the launch event more than just another 'up and down' flight.
